When the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation began offering its expertise, collections and name to new museums around the world some years ago, not a few French curators and art critics sniffed disdainfully at the idea that a major museum should rent its art and sell its brand.
Now France too seems to be heading down a similar path, and opposition is mounting here.
Critics are accusing President Jacques Chirac of using the country's museums to promote France’s political and commercial interests abroad.
When the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation began offering its expertise, collections and name to new museums around the world some years ago, not a few French curators and art critics sniffed disdainfully at the idea that a major museum should rent its art and sell its brand.
Now France too seems to be heading down a similar path, and opposition is mounting here.
Questions are being raised about plans to create a satellite of the Louvre in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, and to establish an outpost of the Georges Pompidou Center in Shanghai. Critics have accused President Jacques Chirac of using the country's museums to promote France's political and commercial interests abroad.
''Museums are not for sale,'' proclaimed the headline of an opinion article in Le Monde on Dec. 13 signed by three heavyweights of the French art world, Françoise Cachin, former director of French museums; Jean Clair, former director of the Picasso Museum; and Roland Recht, a leading art historian.
''From a moral point of view,'' the authors wrote, ''one can only be shocked by the commercial and promotional use of masterpieces of our national heritage.'' France should lend works of art, they said, but without charge. ''Objects of our heritage are not consumer goods,'' they added. ''And to protect them is to guarantee their universal value for tomorrow.''
A French art Web site, La Tribune de l'Art (latribunedelart.com), quickly organized a petition endorsing Le Monde's article and demanding ''preservation of the integrity of the collections of the French museums.''
The government is at the center of the dispute because, unlike most major cultural institutions in the United States, France's national museums are government owned and heavily subsidized. The Culture Ministry appoints their directors and has the last word on major policy decisions.
Thus the ministry endorsed earlier, uncontroversial moves by the Louvre and the Pompidou to spread beyond their walls. Both are now building striking new satellites -- the Louvre in Lens northwest of Paris and the Pompidou in Metz in eastern France -- to display parts of their collection, much of which is permanently in storage.
But eyebrows were raised when the museums reached outside France. The Pompidou had hoped to participate, in collaboration with the Guggenheim, no less, in a major urban and cultural development planned for Hong Kong, but that scheme fell through. Now it is looking to open an annex in Shanghai, perhaps as soon as 2009.
Pompidou officials assert that the aim is not to make money but rather to be present in China as that country emerges as a major new center of contemporary art. And President Chirac, who recently visited China, is clearly eager to use the Pompidou to raise France's profile in the world's fastest growing economy.
With negotiations under way and details still under wraps, the Shanghai plan has so far raised only questions. In their article in Le Monde, Ms. Cachin, Mr. Clair and Mr. Recht asked whether it would not be wiser to expand the Pompidou itself so that it could show more of its collection in Paris.
The Louvre is viewed more skeptically. Last fall it began a three-year loan program to the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, with a series of exhibitions of works taken from its storerooms and walls. In exchange it will receive $6.4 million to be spent on the renovation of its decorative arts galleries.
It is not uncommon for entire collections or exhibitions to receive loan fees. Nonetheless many critics felt it was undignified for the Louvre to be seen exchanging art for money.
Defending the decision, Henri Loyrette, the president and director of the Louvre, argued that the program bolstered the museum's prestige, a claim supported by the popularity of its Atlanta displays. He also said that he considered the money offered by private American donors to be a contribution to the Louvre, and not a fee.
The Abu Dhabi project, however, has raised more complicated issues. If approved, the Louvre annex would be one of five museums planned by Abu Dhabi as part of a multibillion-dollar tourist development on Saadiyat Island. Already last July, the Guggenheim signed a memorandum of understanding with Abu Dhabi to build a museum designed by Frank Gehry.
According to French press reports Mr. Loyrette was barely consulted about the Louvre's involvement and privately expressed reservations, noting that the Louvre's resources were strained by the High Museum program and the Louvre-Lens development. But, the reports said, he was overruled.
The critics have much to work with: the idea of removing major works from the Louvre for long periods; the usefulness of engaging in a tiny oil emirate with a population of under two million and the propriety of receiving a reported $1 billion in exchange. ''Isn't that 'selling your soul?' '' Ms. Cachin, Mr. Clair and Mr. Recht asked in Le Monde.
Some commentators, though, have suggested that the Louvre's participation is itself a payoff. According to a French government report to Parliament, the United Arab Emirates acquired more than $10 billion worth of French armaments, mainly Mirage fighter planes, between 1996 and 2005.
One sign of the political sensitivity of the issue is that inquiries to the Louvre about Abu Dhabi were channeled to the Culture Ministry, where the official in charge did not respond to requests for an interview. Francine Mariani-Ducray, Ms. Cachin's successor, has insisted, however, that loans of art to the emirate did not mean ''selling'' French museums.
Also writing in Le Monde, she charged critics with disdaining small developing countries and said it was a tribute to French cultural influence that France had been invited to share its expertise with Abu Dhabi. ''It is a chance that should be seized,'' she said.
In the government, though, there are signs of still more radical thinking. Last month a report ordered by the Economy Ministry said that France should lift ''several taboos'' on its cultural policy, including allowing museums to rent or sell works of art. The report even cited the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, as a good example of how a brand could be exploited internationally.
It is a fact of French public life that once the president decides something, the rest of the government closes ranks around him. So those defending the uniquely spiritual quality of art may be on the ropes. On the other hand France holds presidential and parliamentary elections in the spring and after that everything could change again.

In movie theaters across the United States on Saturday, people did an odd thing during the main attraction: They clapped. They clapped between scenes and when certain characters left the screen.

In movie theaters across the U.S. on Saturday, the Metropolitan Opera's production of Mozart's "Magic Flute" was broadcast live in high definition.
In movie theaters across the United States on Saturday, people did an odd thing during the main attraction: They clapped. They clapped between scenes and when certain characters left the screen.
''I did at the beginning too,'' said Walter Perron, 88, a retired chemist who was at the Walter Reade Theater in Manhattan. ''And then I thought: Who am I clapping for?''
But habits die hard. The show was a live broadcast, in high definition, of Mozart's ''Magic Flute'' at the Metropolitan Opera, the first of six productions to be broadcast from the Met through April.
''The Magic Flute'' played at 100 theaters, most of them scattered throughout the United States and Canada, with seven in Britain, two in Japan and one in Norway. Though the box office receipts are not all in yet, the broadcasts seemed to be a success, with an average audience capacity of 90 percent, the Met's press office said. Forty-eight of the 60 American theaters were sold out in advance, including those in Boston; Phoenix; Louisville, Ky.; Pittsburgh; and New Brunswick, N.J. Six of the 28 Canadian theaters were sold out, as were all of the locations showing it in Britain, as well as the theater in Norway.
The production selected first for broadcast was in many ways the surest bet. The director Julie Taymor's take on ''The Magic Flute'' played to sold-out houses when it was initially presented at the Metropolitan Opera in 2004. To capitalize on that success, the Met, under Ms. Taymor's guidance, fashioned a 100-minute version in English (down from three hours in German) as a more child-friendly production. Did the broadcasts, as envisioned, attract people new to opera? Hard to say. Interviews at several theaters around the country suggest that the average viewer was already familiar with opera, if not an aficionado. But none of the viewers had had the chance to munch on popcorn at a local cinema in the presence of a live, Met-level performance of the aria ''Dies Bildnis ist bezaubernd schön.''
''This is a good opportunity to see opera without a lot of stress,'' said Erika Homann, who was at a sold-out theater in Livonia, Mich., just outside Detroit, with her husband, their 8-year-old son, 5-year-old daughter and 11-year-old niece.
Audiences tended to be middle-aged or older, though many parents, like Ms. Homann, brought young children. Several viewers said that they had attended productions by local opera companies but had never gone to the Met, which was a plane ride, hotel and $100-plus ticket away. These performances cost $18 a person.
''I have been dying to go to the Met for years,'' said Leighanne Duaro, 47, of Hazel Green, Ala., who was at a theater in nearby Huntsville with her two children, ages 18 and 22, and her sister. ''This is the closest thing you can get to going to the Met, to see the production and not be there.''
The broadcasts did not all go off without a hitch. A theater in Jacksonville, Fla., canceled the showing because of technical problems. Viewers in Lincolnshire, Ill., a suburb of Chicago, had to move at the last minute to another screen in the theater complex.
The broadcast in Burbank, Calif., was plagued with stops and starts, sound problems and, at one point, a screen going completely blank. But though an usher offered refunds, most of the audience stayed to the end, making jokes whenever another glitch occurred and cheering during the curtain calls.
''I think it was just the most incredible thing I've ever experienced,'' said Shawnet Sweets, 45, who works in the box office of the Los Angeles Opera. ''Even with the technical difficulties it was O.K., because that happens in live productions. There's always a mishap.''
There is a difference between seeing opera onstage and on screen, several attendees said. The camera chose the viewpoints and often closed in on a particular character rather than panning to show the whole scene.
''One thing I wished I could have seen more of was how the sets worked,'' said Martha Edwards, 63, who was at the theater in Lincolnshire.
But even those who had nits to pick were quick to add that they enjoyed the show and were planning to buy tickets to future broadcasts. (''The Magic Flute'' will be rebroadcast, though not live; also on the schedule are Bellini's ''I Puritani,'' Tan Dun's ''First Emperor,'' Tchaikovsky's ''Eugene Onegin,'' Rossini's ''Barber of Seville'' and Puccini's ''Trittico.'')
Some viewers even questioned why the Met hadn't tried this already, praising the idea and lamenting the dwindling audience for opera. Few put it better than William T. Robinson III, a 66-year-old retired music teacher, at the theater in Huntsville.
''If you go to many classical performances, you see that a lot of them are senior citizens, baldheaded and white,'' said Mr. Robinson, who is black and was wearing a hat. ''I think there is a need to create a new audience and get more minorities to come to these kind of activities.
''Otherwise,'' he added, ''how are you going to get to the Metropolitan Opera from way down here in Huntsville, Alabama?''

The business of grain marketing has not been its usual sleepy self lately in Western Canada.
Plans by the government to strip the Canadian Wheat Board of its monopoly control over most of the country's wheat and barley exports have provoked a fight that is pitting farmer against farmer and the agency against the government.
Plans to strip the Canadian Wheat Board of its monopoly control over most of the country’s wheat and barley exports have provoked an ideological clash over open markets.
The business of grain marketing has not been its usual sleepy self lately in Western Canada.
Plans by the government to strip the Canadian Wheat Board of its monopoly control over most of the country's wheat and barley exports have provoked a fight that is pitting farmer against farmer and the agency against the government.
The wheat board, founded 75 years ago as part of a wave of cooperative ventures for improving farmers' lives, is now one of the world's largest grain traders, with annual sales of $4 billion to $6 billion.
The board is, in many respects, among the last of the cooperative projects that remains true to its original goals. But those goals now have little in common with the open market philosophy of the minority Conservative government that came to power just under a year ago.
Shortly before Christmas, that clash resulted in an unusual cabinet order to fire the wheat board's president, Adrian Measner.
The fate of the board will be eagerly awaited in the United States, where farm groups have unsuccessfully challenged the Canadian board's monopoly. Among the companies likely to move into Canada's export market, if it is opened, are commercial grain traders like Cargill of Minneapolis and Archer Daniels Midland of Decatur, Ill.
''There is absolutely no doubt that part of the reason the Conservative government is pushing as hard as it is pushing is, I suspect, that they are feeling pressure from the Americans,'' said Murray Fulton, an agriculture economist who directs a center for the study of cooperatives at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon.
The wheat board concept is simple. In exchange for its monopoly over wheat destined for export from Canada's three prairie provinces, as well as a small part of British Columbia, it pays every farmer the same average sale price. Overall, Professor Fulton said, price averaging has provided most farmers with greater stability and higher prices than they would have obtained in an open market.
A study commissioned by the wheat board on barley prices released in December gives more specifics. The report, by Richard S. Gray of the University of Saskatchewan, Andrew Schmitz of the University of Florida and Troy G. Schmitz at Arizona State University, concluded that farmers' barley revenue from the wheat board was 59 million Canadian dollars higher from 1995 to 2004 than it would have been in an open market system.
Wheat board supporters argue that the board also helps farmers by negotiating terms with railways and ports.
The system seems to have supporters on the buyers' side as well. It provides a more uniform grading of grains than is available in the United States, for instance.
But averaging prices has a significant drawback for some farmers. By definition, an average price is often lower than what individual farmers who live near the United States border could obtain by directly trucking their harvest south. The province of Alberta, home to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, has long opposed the board for that reason, among others.
Chuck Strahl, the minister of agriculture, has repeatedly said that all he wants is to give farmers the choice of pooling their risk through the wheat board or going out on their own.
''We are trying to get more marketing choice for farmers,'' he told the House of Commons in December. ''We want to put more money in their pockets. We want them to take advantage of their own expertise.''
Professor Fulton argued in a separate study published last month that the wheat board cannot survive in an open market. Indeed, its history before it was granted a monopoly supports that idea. The operation floundered as farmers chose the open market when prices were high, returning to the board only during hard times.
Mr. Strahl has not found it easy to end the board's monopoly. A 1998 law gave farmers control of the board by letting them directly elect 10 of its 15 directors, with the balance, including the president, being appointed by the government.
(Because the government guarantees the board's finances, however, it retained the power to issue cabinet orders.)
The Conservatives, in the minority, have been unable to get any of the other parties to support changes in the wheat board. An attempt earlier this year to amend the board's legislation was resoundingly defeated by opposition parties.
And when five wheat board positions came up for election this fall, the government heavily promoted candidates who backed its plan. Farmers, however, responded by electing four candidates who favor the current monopoly.
Now Mr. Strahl plans a vote on creating an open barley market early in 2007. But he has also made it clear that the government will not be bound by its results.
The level of support for the government's open market plan is unclear. Even Mr. Strahl said during recent committee testimony: ''I think I've had 4,500 letters on wheat board issues since I've been in office. They are almost equally divided.''
Mr. Measner, a 34-year veteran of the wheat board, had become something of a minor celebrity by rebuffing orders from Mr. Strahl and his staff to stop promoting the monopoly system and start backing the government's plan.
Before his dismissal on Dec. 22, Mr. Measner began a court challenge of a cabinet order requiring the board to support the government, arguing that it is unconstitutional and outside the government's power over the board.
''The government has a direction they're taking the wheat board, and it doesn't matter what people say or what people want,'' Mr. Measner said in an interview from his home after his firing. ''My position is that it should be farmers making the decision.''
Ken Ritter, a farmer from Saskatchewan who is the board's chairman, said the legal challenge of the government's orders will continue as will the board's campaign to keep the current system.
''This is very, very divisive,'' Mr. Ritter said. ''This has gone on for 40 years.''
Professor Fulton said that by firing Mr. Measner and attempting to gag the board, the government runs the danger of alienating even some of the farmers who back its open market position.
''The view seems to be shifting,'' Professor Fulton said. ''Even farmers who might support a change in the wheat board are saying, why do it this way?''

Like Wikipedia, a wiki search engine would be based on the idea that volunteers can do the work of paid specialists -- in the case of search engines, the work of sophisticated computers that evaluate Web sites for relevance using secret criteria.
''The one thing that I feel like I know how to do is build communities,'' Mr. Wales said. ''I mean it differently than the way it is often abused in the Internet community as feedback ratings. I mean people who know each other, who have discussions. In Wikipedia, there are discussions. We want to encourage that here.''
The Wikia search engine would allow users to see how the results were generated and modify those rankings using their own knowledge of the Internet. Any changes could be reversed by a different user, and, as in Wikipedia, long discussions could ensue over the decisions.
''I suspect there is a need for categorization and grouping'' by the volunteers, Mr. Wales said. ''It would not make sense to have a dialogue for each long-tail search. For popular searches, it makes sense.''
''The question is: Will there be a demand?'' he said. ''I think there will be. People are not happy with the lack of transparency.''
Gil Penchina, the chief executive of Wikia, compared the search-engine process to filtering spam.
''Humans are pretty good at that; machines are not so good at that,'' he said. ''What is obvious to a person is not always obvious to a machine. There are all sorts of tricks to fool the search engines. We think that people are better than machines at making decisions about what are proper results for any search term you type in.''
Mr. Wales and Angela Beesley, a co-founder of Wikia, are pivoting from the nonprofit encyclopedia to the world of dot-com start-ups.
Mr. Penchina said that Wikia, which is based in Menlo Park, Calif., had raised $4 million from a group of investors, and that in December it had additionally received ''an undisclosed, significant cash investment'' from Amazon.com.
As for the idea of getting people to donate their work to a for-profit operation, Mr. Wales said, ''Part of the incentive problem is making it fun.''
As Wikia's profile increases, the officials of the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation -- which says it is dedicated to encouraging the growth, development and distribution of free, multilingual content -- say they are trying to make the distinctions between the two more clear. The foundation, ''was originally very related to Wikia,'' said Florence Devouard, who replaced Mr. Wales as chairman, in an e-mail message from France where she lives. And ''accordingly, in the past few months, we have worked on entirely separating the two entities.''
As for concerns that the Wikia search engine, perhaps with groupings and categories, could become more like a for-profit Wikipedia, Ms. Devouard said in the e-mail message that she was not worried.
''There is already a Wikipedia and people aren't going to waste their time reinventing the wheel.''

The paper is introducing its newly designed version -- and smaller size -- tomorrow. It has been touting the design, which it first announced more than a year ago, in a publicity campaign for the last month, building momentum toward the Jan. 2 introduction.
The only problem is that Wall Street is shutting down tomorrow to mark the death of former President Gerald R. Ford. Both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market are following tradition, dating from the burial of Ulysses S. Grant in 1885, in honoring the death of a president by halting trading. That means The Journal's core audience is likely to miss the ballyhooed first issue.
A spokesman for The Journal said that the closing of the markets would not have much affect on the paper's publicity plans, which include giving away half a million copies free at 40,000 newsstands across the country -- most of them not in Manhattan. And most of those copies that are in Manhattan are to be distributed at transportation hubs outside the financial district, like Grand Central Terminal, Penn Station and the Port Authority, to reach ordinary commuters, not the pinstripes downtown.
But the crowning feature of the planned hoopla was for Peter R. Kann, chairman of Dow Jones, which owns The Journal, to ring the closing bell at the New York Stock exchange tomorrow. That prized showcase is now canceled.

Marsh & McLennan Companies, the big New York insurance broker, is planning to sell its troubled mutual fund business, Putnam Investments, to the Power Corporation of Canada for about $3.9 billion.
The transaction would enable the Power Corporation to establish a foothold in the mutual fund business in the United States. It operates IGM Financial, one of the largest mutual funds in Canada.
The sale of Putnam Investments to the Power Corporation of Canada will allow Power to establish a foothold in the U.S. mutual fund business.
Marsh & McLennan Companies, the big New York insurance broker, is planning to sell its troubled mutual fund business, Putnam Investments, to the Power Corporation of Canada for about $3.9 billion.
The transaction would enable the Power Corporation to establish a foothold in the mutual fund business in the United States. It operates IGM Financial, one of the largest mutual funds in Canada.
People who have been briefed on the transaction said that Marsh & McLennan and Power reached an agreement in principle last week and expect to work out the details early in the new year.
A spokesman for Marsh & McLennan would not comment on the transaction. Phone calls to the headquarters of Power in Montreal were not answered over the weekend.
Marsh & McLennan's chief executive, Michael G. Cherkasky, said in September that the company was considering a sale of Putnam, which had been losing business in the aftermath of an industry-wide investigation that began in 2003 into improper trading practices.
In late 2004, Marsh & McLennan was accused of rigging bids for customers of its insurance brokerage, its biggest unit, in an investigation by Eliot Spitzer, then the New York attorney general, that involved all the big insurance brokers. Mr. Spitzer was to be sworn in as governor of New York today.
Marsh & McLennan paid $850 million to settle a lawsuit by Mr. Spitzer -- more than the other brokers paid -- and its business has declined more than its competitors. Analysts have recommended that Marsh & McLennan sell Putnam as a way to help recover.
In November, Marsh said that a long slide in brokerage revenues appeared to have leveled off. It reported growth in its consulting businesses, but a 10 percent decline in revenue at Putnam.
Putnam has about $190 billion in assets under management, down from nearly $400 billion at the start of 2000.
For Power, the purchase, which was reported earlier in The Wall Street Journal, represents an opportunity to expand its success in the Canadian mutual fund industry into the United States. Through a subsidiary, IGM Financial, Power manages about $89 billion in assets. Its funds include some of Canada's best known brands, among them the Investors Group and Mackenzie Financial.
To a large extent, those mutual fund operations are intertwined with Power's life insurance operations: Great West Life Assurance, Canada Life Assurance and London Life Insurance.
A push by Power's financial services group in the United States will also be something of a change in the strategy of the Desmarais family. Since it took control of Power, which was once a electrical utility holding company, the Desmarais family has looked to Europe and Asia as a way to diversify outside of Canada.
In Canada, Power is active in the media through its Gesca group, which owns La Presse of Montreal and six other daily newspapers.
Paul Desmarais, who was born in 1927, dropped out of high school to revive his family's small bus line in Sudbury, Ontario, Mr. Desmarais was so successful that he was soon on an acquisition spree that initially led to his domination of the intercity bus trade in Quebec province and parts of Ontario. A further expansion into insurance and mutual funds led ultimately to his control over Power In 1968.
Mr. Desmarais, his family and Power all have close ties to the Liberal Party of Canada, which has dominated federal politics in Canada. A daughter of Jean Chrétien, the former Canadian prime minister, is married to a member of the Desmarais family. Mr. Chrétien's successor, Paul Martin, once worked for Power and made his fortune through acquiring control of a former Desmarais asset, Canada Steamship Lines.

No children screeching on toboggans. No thwack against a friend's head. No melting on tongues. No snow. November. December, too.
For the last two months, no snow has fallen on Central Park, and it probably won't fall anytime soon, forecasters say. Indeed, not since April 8 has there been even a flurry.
Last month appeared to be the first December without a snowflake in New York City since 1877, when Rutherford B. Hayes was president.
No children screeching on toboggans. No thwack against a friend's head. No melting on tongues. No snow. November. December, too.
For the last two months, no snow has fallen on Central Park, and it probably won't fall anytime soon, forecasters say. Indeed, not since April 8 has there been even a flurry.
The National Weather Service said that last month appeared to be the first December without a snowflake here since 1877, when Rutherford B. Hayes was president.
Moreover, New York City is not alone. Warsaw, Budapest, Berlin, Vienna and Stockholm report little or no snow this season.
It has been so warm in Yaroslavl, a city about 150 miles northeast of Moscow, that Masha the bear, a resident of the city zoo, woke up last month from his hibernation after only a week.
In Central Park on Saturday, where children were gliding along on roller skates and rumbling around on three-wheelers, Rob Flanagan, 35, a general contractor from Hoboken, N.J., was peeved.
''Global warming!'' he said. ''Al might be right!'' Mr. Flanagan was referring to Al Gore, the former vice president and crusader against greenhouse gases. The mild weather stinks, he said. ''I like the snow!''
Stuart Welburn, a lawyer who lives on the Upper West Side, disagreed on behalf of his 9-month-old son, Owen, whom he was carrying on his shoulder.
''This guy is happier without the biting cold,'' Mr. Welburn said, adding that Owen's mother, Melissa, was the same way.
On the other hand, Mr. Welburn and his older son, Will, 21/2, love the snow and tobogganing. ''We play in the snow right there, on that mound in particular,'' Mr. Welburn said, motioning toward a small hill just off the West 72nd Street entrance to Central Park. ''This whole area is well populated with sleds in the winter.''
Jason Krantz, 38, another lawyer who lives on the Upper West Side, said he didn't miss the snow. His two toddlers and a nephew were busy clambering up a big boulder, yelling ''123!'' and then jumping down into Mr. Krantz's outstretched arms.
''I enjoy the snow when it's here,'' Mr. Krantz said as he watched for flying children. ''But I'm just as happy when there's no snow here as well, because you don't have to cover the kids in scarves and gloves and mittens.''
Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University, said mild temperatures were likely to persist in the New York metropolitan region for the next week or so. If there is no snow by Friday, he said, it will break a record established on Jan. 4, 1878, for the latest winter appearance of snow.
Mr. Miner said it was not quite clear why snow had failed to appear. ''The northern branch of the jet stream -- the delivery system of arctic air -- has hunkered down near the Arctic Circle,'' he said. It may be because of a complex interaction between ocean temperatures and snow cover in Canada, Mr. Miner said.
He cautioned that it would be easy to read too much into the lack of snow so far. The previous four winters, Mr. Miner said, each produced more than 40 inches of snow in New York City, nearly double the annual average of 22.4 inches.
Still, Julianne Warren, 40, a conservation biologist visiting New York from Lexington, Va., is concerned. She said she heard a white-throated sparrow in Central Park and saw an azalea blooming.
''Things seem a little --'' she said, and then wiggled her outstretched right hand as if it were an airplane in turbulence. ''It may mean the flowers don't bloom at the right time and birds may not know to migrate at the right time.''

Eliot Laurence Spitzer begins his term as the state's 54th governor today. He has pledged to reform the way the state does business and to bring a higher ethical standard to Albany. He recently outlined a number of sweeping steps that he would take unilaterally, including restricting campaign contributions and banning gifts of more than nominal value. But after promising to look far and wide for talent, many of his appointees come from the attorney general's office, or from his campaign staff. Some key positions remain unfilled, including the job of health commissioner. Here are the top officials who have been named, many of whom require Senate confirmation.

To the Editor:
Regarding your editorial suggesting that I am ''demanding that the entire nation follow one particular theology'' (''Fear and Bigotry in Congress,'' Dec. 23), I have never even hinted at such a thing.
As a practicing Jew, I do not share Christian theology. I am interested in America's moral and civic values, not its theology.
And those values, including the religious liberty that made it possible for non-Christians like Keith Ellison, the newly elected representative from Minnesota, and me to freely practice our religions in America, have come overwhelmingly from the Bible as understood by America's Christians.
So I have suggested that Mr. Ellison bring a Bible along with his Koran to his ceremonial swearing-in -- not to swear on it but to honor it, as has been done since George Washington's inauguration.
This gesture could make an important contribution to both American unity and the image of Islam in America.

IN one of his last books, Romain Gary tells how, as a lover at 59 of a Russian woman of 20, he decided to end the relationship because of the age difference. But, deeply in love, he hesitated. In the cafe where he went to write a letter breaking off the liaison, the server asked him what he wanted. ''Je prendrai une décision,'' he said, I will have a decision. As the server, philosophically, waited for him to place his proper order, he corrected himself. ''Je prendrai une infusion,'' I will have an herbal tea.
The practice of making New Year's resolutions is growing rare in France, perhaps because we spread them out from January to December, a demonstration of a delicate balance between good will and willpower. Descendants of the spiritual exercises of the ancients, resolutions are both educational and therapeutic.
There are two types of resolutions: those that are reasonable, and those that are not.

The practice of making New Year's resolutions is growing rare in France, perhaps because we spread them out from January to December, a demonstration of a delicate balance between good will and willpower. Descendants of the spiritual exercises of the ancients, resolutions are both educational and therapeutic.
In declaring resolutions, if possible before witnesses, we nourish the illusion that changing our lifestyles will change our lives: ''This year, I will read Proust.'' ''This year, I will not invade Iraq.'' ''This year, I will be faithful to my wife.'' ''This year, I will reduce unemployment in France.'' Or, more prosaically, ''I will exercise three times a week, I will finally try to stop smoking, I will cut back on sugar,'' etc. It's a sort of collective drunkenness for people to make vows that nobody expects to keep.
Westerners are athletes of introspection -- we never stop analyzing ourselves. ''It is never too late or too early to care for the well-being of the soul,'' Epicurus said, and so we make our lives a study of ourselves. We need a moment in the year when we look at ourselves, weigh our good and bad habits, evaluate our conduct as a doctor evaluates our health during an annual examination, so we can strive for a way of life that is wiser and more responsible.
There are two types of resolutions: those that are reasonable, and those that are not. The day I took communion, when I was an adolescent and still believed in God, I would decide to be good to everyone, to smile at my family, to spread charity and goodwill. This love for my neighbors, even the ones who annoyed me, lasted two days, and then I returned to being an ordinary human, neither good nor bad, with my moods and my preferences. I could not make myself someone I was not.
Similarly, to declare that in 2007 we resolve to be happy is unreasonable. We can't determine to be happy: it is in our power to avoid certain evils, to stay away from conflict, to not bankrupt ourselves, to not throw ourselves out the window or under a train, but we can't order up happiness as we order a dish in a restaurant or command a dog to come at our call. Happiness eludes the rendezvous we fix, arrives when we least expect it, disappears when we think we have it in hand.
In other words, those people who are unhappy about not being happy forget that happiness has a knack for indirection, coming in the middle of the most ordinary day or disappearing at the height of one's career. It is a matter of luck, almost of grace, a visitor who enters the house unexpectedly and vanishes on tiptoe. ''I recognize happiness by the sound it makes when it leaves,'' said the poet Jacques Prévert.
In contrast, let's imagine someone who sets out on Dec. 31 to ruin his life. It's not certain that ruin will arrive easily: it is no less difficult to destroy one's life than to improve it. Catastrophe is a delicate art that also requires chance. Hell is just as hard to get into as heaven.
If the end of the year brings a flood of resolutions to change, it is because we are faced with an existence that is invaded by the routine, by the rush of demands. We can't bear it. We know that another life exists, more beautiful, more passionate, one that laziness and apathy keeps us from attaining.
I have to break with time to overcome my obstacles, to rediscover myself, to be myself in all innocence. I can change my life, at least in some small way. Making resolutions demonstrates optimism, the desire to make oneself better, a faith, naïve and beautiful at once, that declarations can spontaneously become actions, that saying means doing.
Oh, the glorious day of making a resolution, the belief that starting tomorrow I will be the pilot of my existence, that I will stop being the plaything of external circumstances, that I will govern myself. I'm better than I seem to be -- a person obsessed by little irritants, addicted to talking nonsense -- and I'm going to prove it to the world. The certainty that soon, thanks to my willpower, I will no longer be someone who is habitually late, a slave to my cellphone, a glutton, a distracted driver that can galvanize me, prompt me to change, tear away my imperfect personality. Real life starts now; I can immediately free myself of my neuroses, correct myself. I can rid myself of the fear of failure and of the specter of the failures of the past.
Knowing that you can change your behavior, even by an iota, is essential for holding yourself in esteem. We're often cynical about how resolutions are never kept, but we shouldn't be. Resolutions are perhaps lies, but they're lies of good faith, necessary illusions. As long as we can make them, we are saved, we can control the chaos of destiny; it doesn't matter that we break them and that others view us with skepticism. Every resolution is good simply because it is declared. It is a comedy, perhaps, but it keeps us sane.

I've heard the concern expressed dozens of times by New Orleans residents who are poor and black and still living in enforced exile from their wounded city: Maybe they don't want us back.
You hear it again and again and again, the tone of voice varying from sadness to anger to resignation, but always laced with the unmistakable pain of feeling unwelcome in one's own home. I've come to think of it as the New Orleans lament.

I've heard the concern expressed dozens of times by New Orleans residents who are poor and black and still living in enforced exile from their wounded city: Maybe they don't want us back.
You hear it again and again and again, the tone of voice varying from sadness to anger to resignation, but always laced with the unmistakable pain of feeling unwelcome in one's own home. I've come to think of it as the New Orleans lament.
''They are not trying to bring us home,'' said Geraldine Craig, who is living in a federally sponsored trailer encampment in Baton Rouge. ''Just the opposite. They're telling us to find housing here.''
''It hurts,'' said Mimi Adams, a woman who wore out her welcome with relatives in Houston and Atlanta but has no idea when she might return to New Orleans. ''Even if I could find a place, the rents are too high,'' she said. ''They've gone up a lot. I'm told they don't want us poor folks back, that they're making it a city for the well-to-do. That's what I'm hearing.''
Sixteen months have passed since the apocalyptic flood that followed Hurricane Katrina. More than 13,000 residents who were displaced by the storm are still living in trailers provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Another 100,000 to 200,000 evacuees -- most of whom want to return home -- are scattered throughout the United States.
The undeniable neglect of this population fuels the suspicion among the poor and the black, who constitute a majority of the evacuees, that the city is being handed over to the well-to-do and the white.
If you talk to public officials, you will hear about billions of dollars in aid being funneled through this program or that. The maze of bureaucratic initiatives is dizzying. But when you talk to the people most in need of help -- the poor, the elderly, the disabled, the children -- you will find in most cases that the help is not reaching them. There is no massive effort, no master plan, to bring back the people who were driven from the city and left destitute by Katrina.
Only the federal government could finance such an effort. Neither the city of New Orleans nor the state of Louisiana has anywhere near the kind of money that would be required. ''You've got a lot of people who don't have a place to stay,'' Gov. Kathleen Blanco told me in an interview on Friday, ''and they're spread all over creation.''
The federal government has not come close to meeting the challenge of this overwhelming humanitarian crisis. Instead of a concerted, creative effort to develop housing and organize the return to New Orleans of the poor and working-class families who were the heart and soul of the city, the government focused to a large extent on rolling out travel trailers to temporarily house an embarrassingly small percentage of the people in need.
''FEMA spent a lot on trailers,'' said Governor Blanco, ''trailers that are falling apart right now. And they spent as much money on those trailers in many cases as you would on putting a new house in place.''
The simple fact is that no one at any level of government, city, state or federal, has shown the leadership that was needed in response to this astounding tragedy. I tried to talk about this last week with the mayor of New Orleans, C. Ray Nagin, but he and his chief press aide were on vacation.
The most candid official I spoke with was Raymond Jetson, the chief executive of the Louisiana Family Recovery Corps, an independent, nonprofit group set up by the state in the wake of the storm.
''The most daunting aspect of the recovery is the human recovery,'' he said, ''and at this point it has certainly not received the resources or the attention that it needs.''
What was readily apparent in the aftermath of the botched rescue was the damage to the levees, the ruined homes and the city's devastated infrastructure. ''I don't think,'' said Mr. Jetson, ''that the reality of what was happening in the lives of people and families was as apparent.''
The situation remains desperate for thousands of displaced residents. ''Working families are finding it difficult to re-establish their households,'' Mr. Jetson said. ''People who are out of state want to come back home. The clock is ticking on the people who are living in the FEMA trailer communities. You have some people who are totally isolated from resources. And the emotional well-being of a significant number of people and families is literally in peril.''
This is how the new year is starting out for the victims of the great flood of 2005.

Palestinian groups involved in holding an Israeli soldier who was captured in late June said Sunday that significant progress had been made toward a prisoner exchange that would release him.
A spokesman in Gaza for the military wing of Hamas said Sunday that ''there is a breakthrough'' in the prisoner issue ''and we hope it will be concluded very soon.'' The spokesman, Abu Ubaida, suggested that a deal could be close for the release of Cpl. Gilad Shalit, captured by Hamas and two other militant groups in a raid into Israel on June 25.
A prisoner exchange would release Cpl. Gilad Shalit, captured by Hamas and two other groups in late June.
Palestinian groups involved in holding an Israeli soldier who was captured in late June said Sunday that significant progress had been made toward a prisoner exchange that would release him.
A spokesman in Gaza for the military wing of Hamas said Sunday that ''there is a breakthrough'' in the prisoner issue ''and we hope it will be concluded very soon.'' The spokesman, Abu Ubaida, suggested that a deal could be close for the release of Cpl. Gilad Shalit, captured by Hamas and two other militant groups in a raid into Israel on June 25.
A spokesman for the larger Hamas movement in Gaza, Fawzi Barhum, confirmed Sunday that ''there has been progress,'' while the Palestinian prime minister, Ismail Haniya, of Hamas, said last Thursday that the Israeli soldier would be freed soon.
Egypt has spent months trying to broker a deal. But its efforts have been stymied repeatedly by the refusal of Hamas leaders in exile -- in particular Khaled Meshal, who heads the Hamas political bureau -- to sanction an agreement that would send Corporal Shalit home before hundreds of Palestinian prisoners are released.
The government of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel played down the prospect of quick results. A spokeswoman for Mr. Olmert, Miri Eisin, said a release was not imminent and there remained ''problems,'' a view echoed by the Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat.
Mr. Olmert is to meet Thursday with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in Sharm el Sheik, Egypt, and there has been news media speculation that a deal could be announced there.
The Egyptian foreign minister, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, said a prisoner exchange would be discussed at the meeting. ''The deal is ready,'' he told the London daily newspaper Al Hayat. But the deal ''awaits a Palestinian side capable of taking its own decisions.''
''Once the decision is Palestinian, without foreign pressure, then the exchange will take place,'' Mr. Aboul Gheit said, an apparent and apparently bitter reference to the influence that Syria and Iran have over Mr. Meshal and the military wing of Hamas. Mr. Meshal lives in exile in Damascus, Syria, where the government has rebuffed all Western requests to close his office.
''The deal will be done once both sides agree on the overall deal Egypt has proposed and is trying to put into effect,'' Mr. Aboul Gheit said.
The Egyptians have been working on a deal under which Corporal Shalit would be delivered into their hands. The Israelis, who will not deal directly with Hamas, would then begin to release some Palestinian prisoners, beginning with women and youngsters, with more to follow once the corporal is back in Israel.
The total of Palestinian prisoners to be released has been described variously at 450 to 1,000, including some who have served long sentences in Israeli prisons for serious offenses. The Israelis are always reluctant to release prisoners convicted of involvement in killing Israelis.
Mr. Olmert is also trying to ensure that the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah, gets credit for the swap, not the militants of Hamas and the Popular Resistance Committees who captured Corporal Shalit.
The Palestinian groups put the onus on Israel. ''The swap depends on whether there is an Israeli intention to make it happen,'' said a spokesman for the Popular Resistance Committees, who calls himself Abu Mujahed. He said Corporal Shalit was in good health.
The capture of the corporal resulted in a return of Israeli soldiers to the Gaza Strip, which they had left in 2005. A bloody summer and autumn followed, with a series of Israeli incursions, continuing Palestinian rocket attacks into Israel from Gaza and fierce internal Palestinian fighting as Hamas and Fatah struggled for power.
Mr. Olmert had made the release of Corporal Shalit a condition for a serious meeting with Mr. Abbas, but changed his mind as the situation deteriorated and Washington pressed for some political movement with Fatah.
As of November, Israel was holding 9,075 Palestinian prisoners, including 345 minors, according to the independent Israeli human rights group B'Tselem.
On Friday, the Israeli soldier's father, Noam Shalit, published a letter in the Palestinian daily Al Quds, addressing his son and appealing to his captors.
He wrote: ''The fact that we don't know how you are, how you feel, how you are making it through the winter, and how the Palestinian organizations holding you are treating you, is very hard for us. They declare that you are a prisoner of war, but unfortunately, they are preventing you from receiving the rights to which you are entitled as a prisoner of war according to international law, and also according to the exalted Islamic law.''
Mr. Shalit then quoted verses from the Koran on the treatment of prisoners and said he hoped that during the Muslim feast of Id al-Adha, which began over the weekend, ''a change would take place in the position of the Palestinian organizations holding you,'' to enable the Palestinian families of prisoners held in Israel to soon see their relatives.
He asked the captors to show his son the letter, which ends: ''Don't break before you are released, which is very close, and we are doing all we can so that your release and the release of the Palestinian prisoners will be very close.''

The radio program, Goftegoo Radio, which went on the air last May, has used a debate format to broadcast discussions about any number of formerly taboo issues, but its recent fiery discussions about whether the country should have a nuclear program may be setting new boundaries for talk about one of the most important issues in Iran today.
Fiery discussions over Iran’s nuclear program may be setting new boundaries for talk about one of the most important issues in Iran.
A radio program on a government-run station has been conducting an open debate for the past month about whether Iran should change its tough stance on its nuclear program.
The radio program, Goftegoo Radio, which went on the air last May, has used a debate format to broadcast discussions about any number of formerly taboo issues, but its recent fiery discussions about whether the country should have a nuclear program may be setting new boundaries for talk about one of the most important issues in Iran today.
The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously on Dec. 23 to impose sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program, including barring trade in goods or technology used in the program. The measure is aimed at curbing Iran's program for uranium enrichment, which can also be used for making a nuclear bomb. The Security Council has given Iran a two-month deadline to suspend its program or face tougher sanctions.
Iran has refused to comply with the demand and has said it has the right to enrich uranium under the international Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It contends that its program is for peaceful energy purposes, but the United States and European nations contend that Tehran is trying to develop a nuclear arms program.
Critics inside the country have long been barred from discussing the subject. Reformist newspapers cautiously warned last week that the sanctions could have dangerous consequences for the country. But they refrained from concluding whether enrichment should be suspended to prevent those consequences, apparently fearing that the mere suggestion could lead to a government move to close them down.
But guests on Goftegoo -- which means dialogue in Persian -- have expressed their criticisms fearlessly, with some calling on the government to put the country's other interests before its nuclear program.
The state-owned broadcasting monopoly, which has great power and an enormous budget, is among the few state-run agencies that is not controlled by the government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has refused to back down on the nuclear program in the face of world pressure.
The broadcasting agency reports directly to Iran's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final word on all state matters. The new director, Ezzatollah Zarghami, took over the agency in mid-2005, as Mr. Ahmadinejad took office. Mr. Zarghami is a former general of the conservative Revolutionary Guards who is believed to be close to Ayatollah Khamenei.
Analysts say Mr. Zarghami, who is not close to the president, may be using his closeness to Ayatollah Khamenei to build his own power base. But the motivation behind the political discussions on the program is not completely clear.
''Why have the officials linked the country's development to the nuclear program?'' Sadeq Zibakalam, a professor of political science at Tehran University who has appeared on the show a number of times, asked on a show three weeks ago. ''Why have they tried to convince people with the wrong notion that if we suspend our program we lose our national identity and our independence?''
He said Iran was a developing country whose hospitals and schools still needed major investment. He said spending huge amounts of money for the country's nuclear program -- without mentioning the costs of sanctions or a military confrontation -- would not contribute to the country's development.
Mr. Zibakalam said in an interview that he agreed to appear as a guest on the show only if he could express his opinion freely. His condition was immediately accepted, he said.
The host of the show, Amir Dabirimehr, a 29-year old doctoral candidate in political science, said the purpose of the program was to allow critics to express their opinions.
''The show wants to provide an opportunity for all ideas to be expressed on the state-run media so that they don't turn to other outlets,'' he said. ''We tell our speakers that they are our guests and we will be responsible for whatever they say.''
Many of the people he has invited to appear have been skeptical of his guarantees, though, and have turned down the invitation.
''I welcome the show but it could be dangerous if the state-run media wants to carry the mantle for free speech,'' said Mahmoud Shamsolvaezin, a veteran journalist and media analyst in Tehran. ''If the government really wants to broadcast the voices of its critics, it should let them have their own publications.''
Over a hundred reformist newspapers that criticized the government have been shut down by the authorities, and dozens of journalists have been jailed in recent years.
Many people watch satellite programs beamed from the United States by opposition groups in exile. Satellite television is banned in Iran, but many people ignore the law.
Radio and television channels operated in Iran are controlled by the government agency, whose director is appointed by Ayatollah Khamenei. Goftegoo Radio, a daily show, devotes one or two programs a week to political subjects. It usually has at least two guests, one advocate and one opponent of the subject of the day's debate.
On a program last week, Mr. Zibakalam challenged Yadollah Javani, a senior member of the Revolutionary Guards and an ardent advocate of Iran's nuclear program.
Mr. Javani brushed off the sanctions as insignificant and repeated the government line that the United States was manipulating the Security Council against Iran.
Mr. Zibakalam, in response, said, ''I don't know if you really believe in what you say or you just say that to people.''
He noted that Iran's government had sponsored a conference of Holocaust doubters in Tehran in December and said that it was natural to expect Germany to vote against Iran at the Security Council meeting with that kind of provocation. ''Every time we have to deal with the consequences of our actions, we bring up ideological arguments,'' he said.
''I believe these sanctions are only the tip of the iceberg, and they can have very severe consequences if we don't deal with them within the next two months,'' he warned.

President Hugo Chávez's decision not to renew the broadcast license of RCTV, one of this country's oldest television stations and a frequent critic of his government, has fueled a fierce debate over whether he is stifling dissent in Venezuela as he strengthens his control of the broadcasting industry.
Senior officials in Mr. Chávez's government moved quickly to react to growing international and domestic criticism of the decision. Reporters Without Borders, the Paris-based press freedom group, said the move, which Mr. Chávez announced in a speech before military officers last week, was a ''serious attack on editorial pluralism.'' The group asked Mr. Chávez's government ''to reconsider its stance and guarantee an independent system of concessions and renewals of licenses.''
Critics say President Hugo Chávez is stifling dissent in Venezuela as he strengthens his control of the broadcasting industry.
President Hugo Chávez's decision not to renew the broadcast license of RCTV, one of this country's oldest television stations and a frequent critic of his government, has fueled a fierce debate over whether he is stifling dissent in Venezuela as he strengthens his control of the broadcasting industry.
Senior officials in Mr. Chávez's government moved quickly to react to growing international and domestic criticism of the decision. Reporters Without Borders, the Paris-based press freedom group, said the move, which Mr. Chávez announced in a speech before military officers last week, was a ''serious attack on editorial pluralism.'' The group asked Mr. Chávez's government ''to reconsider its stance and guarantee an independent system of concessions and renewals of licenses.''
Vice President José Vicente Rangel said the decision was not political retaliation but a ''right of the state for reasons that are justified.'' Others officials, however, made it clear that the decision was a reaction to RCTV's editorial policies, particularly in relation to a coup in April 2002 that briefly removed Mr. Chávez as president.
''RCTV's determining role during the events of the 2002 coup must be remembered,'' Willian Lara, the communications minister, said at a news conference on Friday. ''That irresponsible attitude hasn't changed at RCTV.''
The actions of RCTV and other private broadcasters during the chaotic days of the coup are at the heart of their tension with Mr. Chávez's government. Several of the broadcasters appeared to support the coup, substituting coverage of the coup's collapse and Mr. Chávez's return to power with reruns of American movies and Walt Disney cartoons.
Since then, Mr. Chávez has accused the broadcasters of waging a ''psychological war'' against his administration, describing the country's main channels, Globovisión, Televen, Venevisión and RCTV, as ''horsemen of the apocalypse.'' His re-election this month to a six-year term has not tempered his disdain for the traditional news media elite and for RCTV in particular.
''This decision can only be seen as a control strategy and an abuse of power,'' said Ewald Scharfenberg, executive director of the Institute for Press and Society, a group here that examines press freedom issues.
Through elections and personnel changes over the past eight years, Mr. Chávez and his supporters have consolidated power across Venezuela's political institutions, controlling Congress, the Supreme Court and every state government but two. The privately controlled media are one of the areas of society, along with private enterprise, religious institutions and professional sports, outside of Mr. Chávez's control.
Teodoro Petkoff, editor of the opposition-aligned newspaper Tal Cual, described Venezuela's political system as an ''autocracy'' advancing toward ''light totalitarianism,'' in comments this month that inflamed Mr. Chávez's government.
With their vociferous criticism of Mr. Chávez and his policies, private newspapers, television stations and radio broadcasters, along with a small community of Internet bloggers, offer daily evidence that freedom of expression still exists here.
Still, pro-Chávez legislation has enhanced the government's ability to clamp down on critics through legal action or threats of prosecution, creating a ''climate of self-censorship,'' according to Human Rights Watch. A 2004 law subjects television and radio stations to heavy fines or suspension of their licenses for broadcasts deemed to ''condone or incite'' public disturbances.
Similarly, legislators amended the criminal code last year to increase penalties for criminal defamation and libel. Napoleón Bravo, a well-known television journalist, was charged under those new provisions this year for denigrating the Supreme Court by claiming that it was inefficient and suggesting that it be replaced with a brothel.
Since the coup in 2002, two private stations, RCTV and Globovisión, have remained critical of Mr. Chávez while two others, Venevisión and Televen, have become decidedly less so. RCTV's contentious relationship with Mr. Chávez worsened during the coup, when Andrés Izarra, the news operations manager for RCTV, resigned after he said his superiors suppressed coverage of developments about the coup.
Mr. Izarra went on to become Mr. Chávez's communications minister and is now head of Telesur, a pan-Latin American news station that is one of numerous media ventures supported by Venezuela's government in recent years. Federal and regional governments now control five television stations, including one used to broadcast all of Mr. Chávez's domestic speeches and an influential talk show that pillories his critics.
The government also controls eight radio broadcasters and a news agency, and is building a communications satellite with assistance from China that is scheduled to be launched into orbit by 2008. Mr. Lara, the communications minister, said one option for RCTV once its license expires in 2007 would be for Venezuela de Televisión, the government's main broadcaster, to take control of its operations.
Some of Mr. Chávez's dislike for RCTV appears to stem in part from how Marcel Granier, the broadcaster's chief executive, has publicly referred to him as a ''lieutenant colonel.'' The term refers to the rank Mr. Chávez achieved in Venezuela's army, but is also an attempt to mock him as militaristic.
In his speech announcing his decision to not renew RCTV's license, Mr. Chávez, dressed in a military uniform and red beret, appeared to jab at the reference. ''When they try to say that someone is a gorilla, an ignoramus,'' Mr. Chávez said, ''they say he is a lieutenant colonel.''
The tension created by the RCTV decision left some wondering how Mr. Chávez will treat other critics as he starts a new term. ''It leaves a very bad taste that we end the year with this anxiety,'' Archbishop Roberto Luckert of Coro said in comments on private radio. ''This is a trampling of freedom of expression.''

Chief Can't Unpack Yet<center></b></head><p align="left">Ban Ki-moon, new secretary general of UN, will have to wait to enjoy one of more glamorous trappings of his new post: secretary general's official residence on Sutton Place; General Assembly recently approved $4.5 million renovation of residence; Ban and his wife are staying at Waldorf-Astoria until Oct, when work is expected to be completed (M)
When Ban Ki-moon takes over as secretary general of the United Nations on Monday, he may quickly have to grapple with the crisis in Darfur, fighting in Somalia and the continuing strife in the Middle East. But he will have to wait to enjoy one of the more glamorous trappings of his new post: the secretary general's official residence on Sutton Place, the exclusive Manhattan enclave off the East River.
The General Assembly recently approved a $4.5 million renovation of the residence, a 14,000-square-foot neo-Georgian attached town house with four floors and a basement. Until October, when the work is expected to be completed, Mr. Ban and his wife will sleep and entertain in a suite at the Waldorf-Astoria, where they have been living since November.

When Ban Ki-moon takes over as secretary general of the United Nations on Monday, he may quickly have to grapple with the crisis in Darfur, fighting in Somalia and the continuing strife in the Middle East. But he will have to wait to enjoy one of the more glamorous trappings of his new post: the secretary general's official residence on Sutton Place, the exclusive Manhattan enclave off the East River.
The General Assembly recently approved a $4.5 million renovation of the residence, a 14,000-square-foot neo-Georgian attached town house with four floors and a basement. Until October, when the work is expected to be completed, Mr. Ban and his wife will sleep and entertain in a suite at the Waldorf-Astoria, where they have been living since November.
Choi Soung-ah, who has been serving as a spokeswoman during Mr. Ban's transition, said that while he would have preferred to move directly into the Sutton Place residence, ''it's just essential refurbishment that's been pushed off for years.''
''He would rather, of course, be in the official residence and not living in a hotel where he can't really unpack his own things, his own belongings,'' Ms. Choi said. ''There is such a thing as the official residence of the secretary general. Of course that would be better, and it would be very convenient.''
The residence was once home to Anne Morgan, the daughter of J. P. Morgan, the financier. It was donated to the United Nations in 1972 and has not been significantly refurbished since 1950, according to a September report prepared by the secretary general's office.
The report estimated that the renovation effort would cost $4.49 million. Of that, $650,900 would go toward security upgrades, including $137,700 for a digital video-recording system and additional cameras.
The price includes $200,000 to upgrade the kitchen, $100,000 to redo the restrooms and $2.1 million for a central heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system. The upgrades that are not related to security total $255 per square foot.
The General Assembly also approved $202,500 for temporary accommodations for the incoming secretary general and his family. Details in the report hint at the sort of domestic annoyances the departing secretary general, Kofi Annan, has dealt with since he took up the post in 1997. The house currently ''poses safety hazards'' and is prone to ''severe malfunctions, requiring increasingly frequent emergency repairs,'' the report says. Specifically, it describes a ''technologically obsolete'' telecommunications system, an 85-year-old electrical wiring system unequipped to handle the phalanx of communications and security technology required by a modern world leader and an elevator that violates New York City's safety code.
The building is heated with steam, which frequently leaks from ''heavily corroded'' pipes and fittings, the secretary general's report says, damaging walls and furniture. The high-powered fans that are used to address the leaks sometimes make matters worse, by overloading the electrical circuit and causing power failures.
The General Assembly has also approved a separate, extensive renovation of the United Nations headquarters, which is expected to cost $1.9 billion and take seven years.
In the meantime, Mr. Ban, the former South Korean foreign minister, will not have to wait to move into his new office, on the 38th floor of the gleaming Secretariat building. He will do so starting Monday, but not a moment sooner, Ms. Choi said, noting, ''Kofi Annan is still the secretary general until the 31st of December.''

A year ago, as the Mendez-Rojas family slept on New Year's Day after a night of celebrating, a fire was spreading in the walls of their studio apartment on Gerard Avenue in the South Bronx.
At 10 a.m., a neighbor who had gone to throw out the garbage saw smoke. She woke up the Mendez-Rojas family, who gathered their documents -- precious possessions for immigrants -- and left the building.
A year ago, as the Mendez-Rojas family slept on New Year's Day after a night of celebrating, a fire was spreading in the walls of their studio apartment on Gerard Avenue in the South Bronx.
At 10 a.m., a neighbor who had gone to throw out the garbage saw smoke. She woke up the Mendez-Rojas family, who gathered their documents -- precious possessions for immigrants -- and left the building.
When they returned later in the day, they found wires hanging out of human-size holes in the walls, clouds peeking through the ceiling and most of their belongings scattered under ash and water.
Almost a year later, as Rosanna Rojas, 40, and her daughter, Roxana Mendez, 14, gave a tour of their new apartment in the Mitchell Houses in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx, they pointed out the few possessions that survived the fire. There is Ms. Rojas's industrial-size sewing machine, a boombox, and the framed picture of a Frank Lloyd Wright building that Ms. Rojas drew years ago while studying to be an architect in the Dominican Republic, the family's home country. Johnny Mendez, 42, her husband, showed two of his water-damaged law books.
They also like to point out where each item in the house came from. A family they met in the Ruth Fernandez Family Center, the shelter where they lived for seven months after the fire, gave them a bedroom set. Ms. Rojas split the pieces among the family: she and Mr. Mendez took the bed, Roxana got the bureau, and Jonathan, 17, got the nightstands. A friend gave the family bunk beds, which Ms. Rojas separated for her children.
''If it's good, it doesn't have anything to do with the fire, I'll take it,'' Ms. Rojas said.
Ms. Rojas moved to New York in 1990 in hopes of earning money for the family, leaving her husband and son behind. She traveled back and forth while Mr. Mendez practiced law in the Dominican Republic. She gave birth to Roxana there two years later and brought the baby with her to the United States, where she worked in various textile factories through the years and got her immigration status in order. The rest of the family joined them in 2000, although Mr. Mendez -- who is a legal resident of the United States, though not a citizen like the others in his family -- continued to split his time between New York and the Dominican Republic until October 2005, when he decided to stay in New York permanently.
''We were in a studio, but we were stable,'' Ms. Rojas said, speaking about the apartment that was destroyed by the fire.
The couple decided that Ms. Rojas would continue working while Mr. Mendez studied for a law degree that would let him practice in the United States. Now, she works four days a week sewing curtains for C. J. Dellatore Textile, while Mr. Mendez takes English classes five nights a week at LaGuardia Community College in Long Island City, Queens, in preparation for a standardized English exam.
He greets the children when they get home from school and cooks hearty Dominican meals for the family. He makes a mean pork chop.
Explaining the couple's decision to sacrifice some comforts by having Mr. Mendez study rather than work, Ms. Rojas said, ''I'm a little strained, but if we spend the rest of our lives in a factory, then it's not a good future.''
The children attend the Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics, a public high school in East Harlem. When their belongings were destroyed in the fire, they were the most worried about their books. But they never missed a day of school. A guidance counselor who learned that they had lost everything referred them to the Children's Aid Society, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
Yalenis Cruz, the aid society's coordinator at the school, immediately dipped into the fund and gave the family $500 for clothes, toiletries and other basic household items. Ms. Rojas recently bought a couch and will be reimbursed with money from the fund.
Despite having lost everything, the Mendez-Rojas family is optimistic, and concerned more with the future than with the past.
After living in the shelter, Roxana decided that she wanted to be a doctor rather than a fashion designer, so she could help people. Jonathan is waiting to hear back from the colleges he applied to. He expects to enroll in City College in the fall and wants to be a computer systems engineer. Mr. Mendez expects to be practicing criminal law in New York by 2010.
And Ms. Rojas is waiting for all of these dreams to become reality so that she can complete her final year of school and receive her degree in architecture.

A mother and her adult son were shot inside their family's basement apartment in Coram, N.Y., on Saturday, the police said. She was killed and he was badly wounded.
The woman, Amelia Garcia, and her son, Ferneliz Cruz, were found in the kitchen of the apartment on Marie Lane, an otherwise quiet dead-end street in a working-class Suffolk County town of 35,000 residents, about 50 miles east of New York City.
There were no signs of forced entry to the woman’s apartment in Coram, N.Y. Her 30-year-old son was listed in critical condition Sunday evening.
A mother and her adult son were shot inside their family's basement apartment in Coram, N.Y., on Saturday, the police said. She was killed and he was badly wounded.
The woman, Amelia Garcia, and her son, Ferneliz Cruz, were found in the kitchen of the apartment on Marie Lane, an otherwise quiet dead-end street in a working-class Suffolk County town of 35,000 residents, about 50 miles east of New York City.
Ms. Garcia, 52, and Mr. Cruz, 30, were the only ones in the white two-family Cape at the time of the shooting, said Detective Sgt. Edward Fandrey of the Suffolk County Police.
There were no signs of forced entry and the apartment had not been ransacked, Sergeant Fandrey said. Mr. Cruz lived there with his mother, his wife and their two children, an 8-year-old boy and a baby, according to neighbors and the police. Another family lives on the first floor.
Mr. Cruz's wife, Yesenia Hernandez, called 911 at 8:20 p.m., when she returned home with the children, the police said. She found her wounded husband lying on the kitchen floor near his mother, who was dead, the police said.
''This is a normal family, by all accounts, that has been thrust into a tragedy,'' Sergeant Fandrey said.
Mr. Cruz was listed in critical condition last night at Stony Brook University Hospital, the police said. He works for a Wonder Bread distributor and his wife has a part-time job with McDonald's, Sergeant Fandrey said.
Investigators were still not sure if more than one gunman took part in the shooting or if anything had been stolen from the apartment.
''We're still processing the scene and we're continuing to evaluate the evidence as we go, but at this point, we don't know the motive,'' Sergeant Fandrey said yesterday afternoon.
There are only 10 houses on Marie Lane, but neighbors said that they did not know Mr. Cruz or his family well. They have lived for two years in the basement apartment, which has three windows and a single entrance, a side door down a few narrow steps.
One neighbor, Denise Galloway, who has lived on the block for 17 years, said that her son often played with Mr. Cruz's son as Mr. Cruz's mother, Ms. Garcia, stood watch. Ms. Galloway and Ms. Garcia were not able to hold a conversation, though; a native Spanish speaker, Ms. Garcia could not speak English.
Sergeant Fandrey would not disclose the number of shots fired inside the apartment or the type of gun or guns used in the assault. He also did not comment on how many times Mr. Cruz and Ms. Garcia had been shot, or where they had been hit. ''It's all part of the investigation,'' he said.
Anyone with information is asked to call the Suffolk County Homicide Squad at (631) 852-6392. The calls are kept confidential, the police said.

As a New Year's deadline arrived, Russia's natural gas monopoly, Gazprom, struck a deal early Monday to supply gas to Belarus for the next five years, averting a price dispute that threatened to disrupt supplies to Europe, the company said in a statement.
The agreement, reached as the Russian capital celebrated the New Year with rolling displays of fireworks, more than doubled the price that Belarus will pay for natural gas this year and raised it significantly in the years to come.
Gazprom struck a deal to supply gas to Belarus for the next five years, averting a price dispute that threatened to disrupt supplies to Europe.
As a New Year's deadline arrived, Russia's natural gas monopoly, Gazprom, struck a deal early Monday to supply gas to Belarus for the next five years, averting a price dispute that threatened to disrupt supplies to Europe, the company said in a statement.
The agreement, reached as the Russian capital celebrated the New Year with rolling displays of fireworks, more than doubled the price that Belarus will pay for natural gas this year and raised it significantly in the years to come.
For Belarus, a close ally of Russia, the price of gas would rise to $100 per thousand cubic meters in 2007, from $46 now, and increase steadily to the level paid by European countries by 2011, the company said.
Gazprom, Russia's largest company, succeeded in achieving, at least in part, what its officials had described as a central goal: ending subsidized supplies of energy to the countries of the former Soviet Union. Belarus, led by its autocratic president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, has for years benefited from the comparatively inexpensive supply of natural gas, a vital part of its sclerotic economy, still mostly managed by the state.
The agreement headed off a shutdown of supplies to Belarus and beyond, avoiding the disruptions of last year, when the effects of a price dispute with Ukraine rippled throughout Europe and raised concerns about Russia's reliability as an energy supplier.
Gazprom, closely allied to the Kremlin, threatened to cut off gas supplies again beginning Monday at 10 a.m. if Belarus did not agree to the higher prices. At least 20 percent of Russian natural gas destined for Europe passes through Belarus, less than the amount that transits Ukraine but enough to raise new concerns in Europe.
The agreement was reached after months of negotiations -- and a final week of threats and counterthreats. Belarus's prime minister, Sergei S. Sidorsky, arrived in Moscow on Sunday for a last round of negotiations and announced the deal with Gazprom's chairman, Aleksei B. Miller. Mr. Miller had suggested that Belarus should ultimately pay the going market price, now roughly $260 per thousand cubic meters of gas.
The agreed price, $100 per thousand cubic meters, was less than the $105 that Gazprom had demanded in the past few days. But under the deal announced on Monday, Gazprom, in keeping with its stated goals of expanding its export empire, will acquire 50 percent of Beltranzgaz, the Belarussian gas-transit monopoly that distributes gas through the country.
Mr. Lukashenko, whose rule has been described as the last dictatorship in Europe, had previously vowed never to give up control of those pipelines. On Friday, he vowed that Belarussians would rather live in unheated dugouts than pay the higher prices that Gazprom was demanding. ''All this means destruction of our relations,'' he said.
A statement by Mr. Sidorsky early Monday appeared to reflect his government's unease with the agreement. ''The Belarussian side, in a difficult atmosphere on the eve of the new year, signed an agreement on unfortunate terms,'' he said, according to Agence France-Presse.
Russia has long been the country's most reliable partner, shielding it from efforts by Europe and the United States to isolate Mr. Lukashenko, who won re-election to a third term as president in balloting in March that was denounced as unfair. But the negotiations suggested that Russia's political priorities had been surpassed by Gazprom's economic ones.

New Year's celebrations were officially canceled in Bangkok and in the northern city of Chiang Mai. But when midnight struck, cheers went up in Bangkok and the sky was filled with bursts of fireworks.
Bangkok, which remains under martial law following a coup three months ago, canceled New Year’s celebrations.

New Year's celebrations were officially canceled in Bangkok and in the northern city of Chiang Mai. But when midnight struck, cheers went up in Bangkok and the sky was filled with bursts of fireworks.
Six of those wounded were foreigners, the police said, including one American.
The national police chief said he doubted that Muslim insurgents from southern Thailand were involved in the bombings, leaving the likelihood that the violence was tied to the country's continuing political tensions.
Thaksin Shinawatra was ousted as prime minister in a nonviolent coup on Sept. 19, and the junta has said there is a continuing threat of instability from his backers. The civilian government it appointed approved funds last week for a 14,000-member special operations force to maintain civic order.
''The bombs exploded almost simultaneously,'' said Gen. Surayud Chulanont, the interim prime minister, as he visited the wounded at a hospital on Sunday. ''It must have been planned.'' But he said it was too early to conclude who was responsible.
Police officers were sent to guard the sites of the bombings and to secure other possible targets. Hotels tightened security, shopping malls closed early and the police cleared Khao San Road, a street that is closed to traffic where backpackers from around the world gather to celebrate the New Year.
The national police chief, Gen. Ajirawit Suphanaphesat, said that at least six bombs had exploded and that the police were inspecting suspicious packages in several other areas.
Officials said two people had been killed and as many as 26 wounded in scattered locations that included a bus stop, a parking area near a shopping mall, a small open market and two police posts.
Bangkok's mayor, Apirak Kosayothin, closed a New Year's celebration in a public square more than three hours early and said other public countdowns would also be canceled.
''Due to several bomb explosions in Bangkok and for the sake of peace and security, I would ask all of you to return to your homes now,'' he told a crowd of 5,000 people. The police then began clearing the square.
Crowds remained in the streets for some time, however, waving at the cameras from behind television reporters at the scenes of some of the bombings.
''Police reinforcements have been sent to various areas in the city,'' said the government's spokesman, Yongyuth Malyalarp. ''We urge the public to remain calm, continue with the celebration but at the same time keep a lookout for any irregularities.''
An insurgency in the three largely Muslim provinces of southern Thailand has taken more than 1,900 lives over the past two years. Shootings and bombings have become an almost daily occurrence. But so far, the violence from that insurgency appears not to have spread to Bangkok and other parts of the country.
The southern violence appears to have a number of causes. The ethnic Malay Muslims have complained over the years of neglect and discrimination by officials in the distant capital in this largely Buddhist nation.
Thailand's political crisis did not end with the coup, which brought to a halt a period of mounting tension that included large demonstrations against the prime minister earlier in the year.
Mr. Thaksin was abroad at the time, and the question of his possible return continues to preoccupy people here. The junta has said its interim government will draw up a new constitution in preparation for an election late next year.
But it has delayed lifting martial law, saying unidentified ''undercurrents'' of pro-Thaksin opposition continue to present a threat.
Abhisit Vejjajiva, the leader of the minority Democrat Party, said Saturday that he expected Mr. Thaksin's supporters to step up political attacks on the military-backed government in the coming year.
He referred to recent accusations of corruption against General Surayud, the interim prime minister, and said, ''Such fighting will be more fierce next year.''

Kills Boxer, 28, In a Dispute Outside a Bar<center></b></head><p align="left">Professional boxer Kemal Kolenovic is killed when car drives up on sidewalk outside Moonlight Restaurant and Bar in Belmont section of Bronx following argument between Albanian immigrants; was not part of argument; photos (M)
A professional boxer was killed in the Bronx early yesterday when a barroom argument spilled outside and one of the men involved drove his sport utility vehicle into a group of people on the sidewalk, the police and witnesses said.
The fight began inside the Moonlight Restaurant and Bar on Belmont Avenue in Belmont, apparently brought on by arguments over which Albanian clan was superior, witnesses said.

A professional boxer was killed in the Bronx early yesterday when a barroom argument spilled outside and one of the men involved drove his sport utility vehicle into a group of people on the sidewalk, the police and witnesses said.
The fight began inside the Moonlight Restaurant and Bar on Belmont Avenue in Belmont, apparently brought on by arguments over which Albanian clan was superior, witnesses said.
The boxer, Kemal Kolenovic, 28, was not involved in the argument, which started about 4:30 a.m.; he had stepped outside to see what the fight was about, the police said.
''He was trying to break up the fight,'' said Tony Mujoovic, 35, the victim's uncle. ''They were drinking. That's a big part of it, I think.''
At some point, the police said, one of the men climbed into a dark S.U.V. and plowed into the crowd on the sidewalk. The man, thought to be a regular at the bar, fled in the S.U.V. and remained at large last evening, the police said.
Mr. Kolenovic had his back to the vehicle when he was struck, and was thrown head-first into a tree, his friends and the police said. He was pronounced dead shortly afterward at St. Barnabas Hospital.
Mr. Kolenovic, an ethnic Albanian, was originally from Montenegro, moving to Brooklyn in 1993, Mr. Mujoovic said, adding, ''He was a very good person. Everybody likes him.''
Described as aggressive in the ring, Mr. Kolenovic, 5 feet 7 inches tall, fought in the welterweight division with a record of 10 wins, six losses and two draws, according to boxing records.
He won his last fight by a technical knockout at the United States Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, N.Y., on Dec. 15, and had hoped to fight at the Loews Paradise Theater in the Bronx on Jan. 25, lacking only an opponent, said Tony Kalaj, a spokesman for the fight's promoter, Joe DeGuardia Star Boxing.
''He was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He went outside just to see what was going on,'' Mr. Kalaj said. ''He was going to start serious training on Tuesday.''
Even a defeat won Mr. Kolenovic fans in Reading, Pa., where he lost a split decision at the Sovereign Center there last May, according to Don Stewart, who covers boxing for The Reading Eagle.
There were boos when the decision was announced, Mr. Stewart said. ''It was such a good fight, he got a little bit of a fan base here,'' he added. ''They wanted him to come back.
''He was real charismatic in the ring. He would jump up and down in the corner before the rounds. He was a real tough little guy. It's a boxing cliché, but he was a hard-luck journeyman who couldn't get a break. He had fights that could have gone his way but didn't for whatever reason.''
His trainer of nine years, Raymond Paolillo, 78, said the boxer was in the process of moving to the Bronx, where he trained, and that his skills in the ring were improving.
''He was a tough fighter. Bob and weave,'' Mr. Paolillo said outside the bar, with tears in his eyes. ''I miss him a lot. He was a high-strung kid and a nice kid. A tough kid,'' he said. ''The party's over.''

City, state and federal agencies granted final approvals last month to a half-dozen wide-ranging projects in a political aligning of the stars that will promote New York City's most ambitious economic development agenda in decades.
Approval or financing was given to a Second Avenue subway; an extension of the Flushing Line to the Far West Side; a spur to connect the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal; financing for tens of thousands of apartments for low- and moderate-income residents; the Atlantic Yards complex near Downtown Brooklyn, which includes a new home for the basketball Nets; and even the bus-stop shelters and public toilets that New Yorkers and visitors have demanded for years.
Projects ranging from transit infrastructure to public toilets will promote New York City’s most ambitious economic development agenda in decades.
City, state and federal agencies granted final approvals last month to a half-dozen wide-ranging projects in a political aligning of the stars that will promote New York City's most ambitious economic development agenda in decades.
Approval or financing was given to a Second Avenue subway; an extension of the Flushing Line to the Far West Side; a spur to connect the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal; financing for tens of thousands of apartments for low- and moderate-income residents; the Atlantic Yards complex near Downtown Brooklyn, which includes a new home for the basketball Nets; and even the bus-stop shelters and public toilets that New Yorkers and visitors have demanded for years.
Some of the approvals were prompted by legal deadlines and last-minute efforts by departing Pataki administration officials -- including Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation; Peter S. Kalikow, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority; and the governor himself -- to stake out their legacy.
But two more enduring forces also converged: the beginning of the last 1,000 days of the Bloomberg administration, and a climate that some urban planners suggest signals at least a lull in the nearly half-century backlash against the bulldozer diplomacy of Robert Moses.
''It's a pretty amazing list,'' said Robert D. Yaro, the president of the Regional Plan Association, a group that studies transportation and development issues. ''It's the Bloomberg administration pushing hard. There's a pro-growth, long-range theme behind all this.''
Kenneth T. Jackson, the Columbia University urban historian, said that Mr. Bloomberg's speech in December outlining the challenges posed by a growing population ''signaled that New York had to fight for its place at the table, that real estate and commercial rents and housing prices are getting out of hand. The only way the city can prosper is to make that more reasonable and the only way to do that is to increase the supply.
''I think they're beginning to move,'' Professor Jackson said.
In the months ahead, the Bloomberg administration's development agenda includes rezoning in Harlem as well as in Jamaica and Willets Point in Queens. The administration also wants to make another effort to gain approval for the transformation of the James A. Farley general post office building in Midtown Manhattan into a commuter rail hub called Moynihan Station -- one proposal that appears to be in political limbo.
''After 9/11, a spirit of cooperation -- not perfect -- prevailed that enabled people to aim farther than they had in decades,'' said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, who was instrumental in winning many of the approvals. ''The mayor really encouraged that kind of thinking -- repositioning New York City's economy to compete with other cities in the 21st century.''
Several of the approved projects still face court challenges. Some others are bound to raise concerns over displacement and congestion. And the promise of a Second Avenue subway has been dangled before skeptical New Yorkers for nearly 80 years. But even if some projects are delayed, the others would change the city's face and, arguably, help fend off competition from New Jersey and from other world capitals.
''I think you probably would have to go back to the late 1930s to see anything like that,'' Mr. Doctoroff said. ''I don't think any mayor has had an agenda like this, not since La Guardia.''
On Dec. 6, the city sold $2 billion in bonds to extend the No. 7 subway line 1.1 miles west and then south from Times Square to 11th Avenue and 34th Street to help transform the largely fallow Far West Side.
On Dec. 18, the federal government agreed to grant $2.6 billion to link Long Island Rail Road commuters directly to the East Side of Manhattan and $693 million for the Second Avenue subway from 96th to 63rd Streets.
On Dec. 19, Mr. Pataki presided over the installation of the first two huge steel columns to mark the perimeter of the Freedom Tower at the World Trade Center site.
The same day, Mr. Bloomberg announced the installation of the first 24 of 3,300 bus-stop shelters by a company that will also replace 330 newsstands and install and operate 20 public toilets. The ''street furniture'' will help pay for the city's tourism campaign.
On Dec. 20, the City Council, in a compromise supported by the mayor, voted to overhaul a tax break to induce developers to build tens of thousands of apartments for New Yorkers making less than 80 percent of the median household income, or $56,720 for a family of four.
That day, a state oversight board gave final approval to the $4 billion Atlantic Yards project, a mostly residential complex with a basketball arena, offices and retail space near Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues.
In addition, new stadiums are being built for the Yankees and the Mets.
Brad Lander, the director of the Pratt Center for Community Development, a planning group, said: ''My guess is, we are only just now settling into the general sense that the city's growth and development are long-term trends, not a short-time, business-cycle flash.''
Dick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union, said that the city, bolstered by a robust economy, was trying to meet pent-up demand.
''Say what you want about the scope and size of development,'' he added, ''the projects that are being approved are more sensitive to the current communities and neighborhoods or to creating new ones -- like the new Downtown Brooklyn -- than Moses ever was.''
Moreover, Mr. Dadey said, ''the community boards no longer have the sway they once did over stopping local projects,'' and some local groups are even supporting development -- ''trying to encourage it responsibly in ways that benefit a greater number of people.''
In ''The Power Broker,'' Robert A. Caro in 1974 wrote that without the approval of Robert Moses, who oversaw virtually all public works in New York until he was eased out in 1968, the city was ''utterly unable'' to build anything.
Mr. Caro said in an interview that he, too, was struck by the plethora of projects approved in December.
''Does this alignment of stars show that this is may be a problem that democracy can solve?'' he said. ''For the first time in 40 years, I'm hopeful.''

For a half-century, he has been the center of a heartbreaking mystery, this boy of 4 or 5 who lies buried beneath a black granite stone in the shade of rhododendrons.
Visitors to his grave in Ivy Hill Cemetery here pray and leave toys, perhaps bestowing more love on this child than he ever had in his life, which was marked by sickness and hunger and ended in a beating.
For a half-century, a young boy found beaten to death in the outskirts of Philadelphia has been the center of a heartbreaking mystery.
For a half-century, he has been the center of a heartbreaking mystery, this boy of 4 or 5 who lies buried beneath a black granite stone in the shade of rhododendrons.
Visitors to his grave in Ivy Hill Cemetery here pray and leave toys, perhaps bestowing more love on this child than he ever had in his life, which was marked by sickness and hunger and ended in a beating.
The boy's body, bruised and naked, was found in a cardboard box in a patch of woods off a dirt road on the city's outskirts in February 1957. He was a symbol of child abuse at its worst. Yet all these years later, he has no name.
William H. Kelly, a retired Philadelphia detective, and his friend Joseph McGillen, a retired investigator for the medical examiner's office, visit the boy's grave often. ''My little friend,'' Mr. Kelly calls him. The men, both 79, dream of giving the boy an identity before they die.
Still officially an open homicide investigation, the case is ''one of the very few in which we can't say who it is,'' said Capt. Benjamin Naish, a Philadelphia police spokesman.
Elmer Palmer was the first officer on the scene that drizzly Feb. 26, 1957. ''It looked like a doll,'' he recalled recently. ''Then I saw it wasn't a doll.'' The boy's hair had been cut, crudely, either just before or just after death, so his body was flecked with hairs.
Mr. Palmer, now 79, was a young husband and father then. He recalled shivering in his raincoat, thinking, ''What a shame.'' At least this will be solved quickly, he thought. ''They had so many leads.''
But there were problems. A college student had spotted the body on Feb. 25, but did not call the police until the next day, after confiding in a priest. Cold slows decomposition, so it was impossible to tell how long the boy had been dead.
An autopsy showed that the child had been beaten to death and that he had been ill and undernourished. His baby teeth were intact, and he had apparently never been to a dentist. His body bore several small scars that looked like surgical incisions. Yet a survey of local doctors and hospitals turned up nothing. Photographs of the boy's face were printed in the newspapers, hung on storefronts and mailed with utility bills throughout Philadelphia and beyond. Orphanages and other child-care institutions were checked. Still nothing.
Detectives even dressed the corpse and photographed it in a sitting position, then distributed the pictures in the hope that the more ''lifelike'' appearance would jog someone's memory.
A man's corduroy cap found near the body was traced to an area store. The owner recognized it from the strap the buyer had her sew on. She recalled him as a man in his 20s who had come into the store alone. There was nothing special about him. He was never found. The police traced the cardboard box to another store. It was one of a dozen that had held bassinets sold from Dec. 3, 1956, to Feb. 16, 1957. Investigators tracked down all but one buyer -- quite a feat, considering the store's cash-only policy -- but found no link to the boy.
Among the many tips and theories: the boy was a refugee who came to America after the Hungarian Revolution of 1956; he was the son of wandering carnival workers, several of whose children had died under odd circumstances; he was the son of an itinerant roofer who had worked in the Philadelphia area.
More than 11,000 Hungarian passports were checked. The carnival workers were cleared. The roofer was found, along with his son, safe and sound.
Finally, the boy was buried in a potter's field, with detectives as pallbearers. His grave was the only one with a stone, donated by a local monument maker.
Years went by. The patch of woods was bulldozed for houses; the dirt road became a busy street. Investigators who had worked on the case acquired paunches and pensions. But for all the big-city death and mayhem they had seen, they could not forget the little boy.
The Vidocq Society, a Philadelphia group composed largely of law enforcement professionals who investigate long-unsolved crimes, adopted the case. Mr. Kelly and Mr. McGillen are members. (The society is named after a famed 18th-century French detective, Eugène François Vidocq.)
Another member was Remington Bristow, an investigator in the medical examiner's office who had been deeply affected by the case. His own son had died in early childhood.
Mr. Bristow worked on the case practically full time, even in his retirement, spending thousands of dollars of his own to chase leads across the country. He carried a death mask of the child in his briefcase.
Until his death in 1993, Mr. Bristow theorized that the child was the son of an unmarried daughter of a couple who ran a foster home in an old mansion. He even suggested that the child might have died accidentally.
The boy's D.N.A. was obtained when the body was exhumed in 1998 and reburied in Ivy Hill, in a plot donated by the cemetery. Those close to the case hold out hope that a match will turn up one day.
Mr. Kelly and Mr. McGillen say the key to the mystery may lie in the memory of a woman who grew up in Philadelphia and says that when she was a child her parents brought a boy home and kept him in the basement. One day, the woman says, her mother battered the boy to death, then drove with her to the patch of woods to dispose of the body.
The woman told her story to Mr. Kelly and Mr. McGillen several years ago, in the presence of her psychiatrist. She said she decided to come forward after a television reprise of the case, one of several in recent years.
''We think she's the real deal,'' Mr. McGillen said.
But William Fleisher, a former Philadelphia police officer and F.B.I. agent who is the president of the Vidocq Society, is not so sure. ''Nothing she says has been proved, nothing she says has been disproved,'' said Mr. Fleisher, now a private investigator.
And if the boy remains without a name and the crime goes unpunished? Sooner or later the killer will be ''in a place where there's no appeal,'' Mr. McGillen said. ''And I feel good about that.''

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. made judicial pay the sole topic of his second annual report, issued on Sunday, declaring that the failure by Congress to raise federal judges' salaries in recent years has become a ''constitutional crisis'' that puts the future of the federal courts in jeopardy.
He noted that judges had fallen well behind the American labor force as a whole in keeping up with inflation over the past 25 years, with judges' pay having declined by 23.9 percent since 1969, adjusted for inflation, while the national average for all wages rose by 17.8 percent.
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. declared that the failure by Congress to raise federal judges’ salaries in recent years has become a “constitutional crisis.”
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. made judicial pay the sole topic of his second annual report, issued on Sunday, declaring that the failure by Congress to raise federal judges' salaries in recent years has become a ''constitutional crisis'' that puts the future of the federal courts in jeopardy.
He noted that judges had fallen well behind the American labor force as a whole in keeping up with inflation over the past 25 years, with judges' pay having declined by 23.9 percent since 1969, adjusted for inflation, while the national average for all wages rose by 17.8 percent.
Given such a ''dramatic erosion of judicial compensation,'' the chief justice said, it was ''clear that the time is ripe for our nation's judges to receive a substantial salary increase.''
His annual report noted that his predecessor, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, had spoken out on the issue of judicial pay for 20 years. Chief Justice Roberts himself mentioned it, among other topics, a year ago in his first report.
He decided to make the subject his sole policy focus this time, he said, in the hope that ''people will take notice'' of a problem that ''has now reached the level of a constitutional crisis that threatens to undermine the strength and independence of the federal judiciary.''
Federal judges rarely left the bench in the past but are now leaving at an increasing rate, 38 in the past six years, including 17 in the last two years. ''Inadequate compensation directly threatens the viability of life tenure,'' the chief justice said.
Further, he noted that judges were increasingly drawn from among lawyers already working in the public sector, often as state court judges or federal magistrate judges. Fewer than 40 percent of new federal district judges come from the private sector, Chief Justice Roberts said, adding, ''It changes the nature of the federal judiciary when judges are no longer drawn primarily from among the best lawyers in the practicing bar.''
By statute, federal district judges receive the same salaries as members of Congress, now $165,200 a year. Judges on the federal appeals courts receive $175,100; associate justices of the Supreme Court, $203,000; and the chief justice $212,100. The linkage of district judges' and Congressional salaries means that judges pay the price when members of Congress discern that it would be politically unpopular to raise their own pay.
That is not the only problem, from the judges' perspective. Their last substantial pay raise was a 25 percent increase provided by a 1989 law, the Ethics Reform Act, under which judges lost the right to earn most types of outside income in return for the raise and the promise of regular cost-of-living increases. But there were no increases in 5 of the last 13 years. Congress ended its 2006 session without providing a cost-of-living increase for the current fiscal year. ''Congressional inaction in the face of this situation is grievously unfair,'' the chief justice said.
The outlook may be somewhat brighter for 2007. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who will take over as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on Sunday praised the chief justice's report and said he would ''do what I can to convince Congress to fairly evaluate this issue and the chief's arguments.'' A cost-of-living increase ''should be an early item of business that the new Congress can accomplish,'' Mr. Leahy said.
Mr. Leahy noted that a bill he sponsored four years ago to make up for the missed cost-of-living increases had passed the Senate but failed in the House of Representatives. ''I hope Congress and the president will reconsider such a measure this year and will do their duty when it comes to fair compensation for the independent judiciary,'' he said.
As earnings have soared in recent years for lawyers at the top firms, federal judges have found it galling that their own law clerks outstrip them within a year or two of entering private practice. Including salary and year-end bonuses, first-year associates at leading New York City firms earned as much as $175,000 in 2006. On top of that, firms offer a signing bonus of $200,000 to entice Supreme Court law clerks to join their ranks.
Chief Justice Roberts, who earned slightly more than $1 million from his law firm in 2003, his last full year in private practice, said judges did not expect to keep up with what they could earn in private life. ''We do not even talk about comparisons with the practicing bar anymore,'' he said.
For the last several years, judges discussing the pay question have pointed to a different benchmark that they regard as a more realistic indicator of how far they have lagged: the difference between judges' pay and the salaries in legal academia.
Justice Stephen G. Breyer, a former law professor himself, testified in 2002 at a hearing of the National Commission on the Public Service, a private group headed by Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Justice Breyer presented charts showing that while in 1969, federal district judges earned slightly more than law school deans, $40,000 compared to $33,000, and substantially more than the $28,000 earned by senior law professors, the situation by 2002 was completely reversed. In that year, the judges were earning $150,000, compared to $250,000 for the professors and $325,000 for the deans.

CLEANING AND REPAIRING  Conservators have spent the last two years cleaning all 15,876 tiles, reattaching broken segments and repainting the tiles to match their original colors.
REPLACING DAMAGE  About 10 percent of the tiles were beyond repair. New ones were made in Stokeon-Trent, England, for $250 to $270 each.
REINSTALLING TILE PANELS  The 49 panels alternate between two patterns. Three panels, consisting only of brand new tiles, will be placed in one of the two side loggias.

UPPER TERRACE  A new waterproof membrane will catch water leaking through the pavement and redirect it to a subsurface drain before it reaches the ceiling tiles.
STEEL SUPPORTS  Brick arches have been replaced by steel beams, which, together with the existing wrought iron girders, will act as the primary support for the road above.
CAST IRON RIBS  The ornamental cast iron framework was painted a shade of gold with mica powder for extra sheen, accented by blue and reddish brown. Not much is known about the framework's historic colors other than that they were ''richly gilded.''
TILE PANELS  Tiles on each panel are fused with mortar, then screwed into a metal frame so they can be installed into the cast iron ribs as a single unit.
Each panel has 324 encaustic, or inlaid, tiles. They were made using small pieces of colored clay laid into a mold and baked together so that the colors are embedded, not just a surface glaze.

Thousands of mourners filed past the coffin of former President Gerald R. Ford on Sunday as he lay in state below the Capitol dome, many saying they came to pay overdue respect to an overshadowed leader.
''We owe him a debt of gratitude, and we never really expressed it,'' said Tim Fain, a consultant for I.B.M. who lives a few blocks away from the Capitol.
Many of those who passed Gerald R. Ford’s casket said they came to pay overdue respect to an overshadowed leader.
Thousands of mourners filed past the coffin of former President Gerald R. Ford on Sunday as he lay in state below the Capitol dome, many saying they came to pay overdue respect to an overshadowed leader.
''We owe him a debt of gratitude, and we never really expressed it,'' said Tim Fain, a consultant for I.B.M. who lives a few blocks away from the Capitol.
''He didn't ask to be president,'' Mr. Fain said. ''He didn't have an agenda. He was a good man, an honorable man, who was asked to do a horrible job, through no fault of his own, and came through and brought the country back together.''
Mr. Ford's memorial did not bring out the kind of crowds or emotions that President Ronald Reagan's did two years ago, when the round-the-clock viewing attracted tens of thousands who waited in line for five hours or more. The wait to see Mr. Ford's coffin was seldom longer than an hour.
Indeed, many in the crowd said they came as much to honor the office of president as the man who had occupied it for two and a half tumultuous years in the 1970s. More people talked about Watergate, Vietnam and inflation than about Mr. Ford's words or deeds. Mourners gawked at the Capitol's art and architecture as guards guided them in and out. Almost everyone interviewed said they happened to be in town or lived nearby.
''Not a lot of presidents are going to be dying in the near future,'' said Frank Lopes, an advertising executive from Asbury, N.J. ''It is an opportunity to see how the respect is paid.''
Marissa Hyde brought her young daughter from the Virginia suburbs because, Ms. Hyde said, ''This is a history-making event, and it is not every day that we live in the nation's capital and can see something like this.''
Filing out of the rotunda, where Mr. Ford's coffin lay on the bier once used for Lincoln and under the painting of ''The Apotheosis of Washington'' in the eye of the dome, some said they were surprised by a wave of feelings for Mr. Ford. Ms. Hyde, for one, left choking back tears.
R. J. Konkoleski, a hospice worker from Adena, Ohio, who was born in 1977, the year Mr. Ford left office, said, ''It was a lot more moving than I even anticipated.'' Mr. Konkoleski said he happened to be visiting friends on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and came to the Capitol out of a sense of patriotic duty. But he left marveling at the chain of circumstances that elevated Mr. Ford to lead the most powerful nation in the world, saying, ''Would he have made it if all the 'ifs' weren't there?''
Joanne Richcreek, who said she had arrived from Fairfax, Va., before 7 a.m., said she came partly because of a first-hand experience with Mr. Ford. While she was still working for the government, Ms. Richcreek said, she once had to call the Michigan office that he maintained after leaving the presidency, expecting to talk to a secretary. ''A guy got on the phone and said, 'This is Jerry. Who is this?' '' she recalled. ''He was very friendly, so there was this personal connection.''
Two of the former president's sons, Jack and Steve, spent time Sunday afternoon shaking hands with visitors before they filed past the coffin, thanking each one on behalf of the family. Former Senator Bob Dole, Mr. Ford's running mate in 1976, came to pay his respects and appeared surprised to see Jack Ford.
Although few said they had traveled long distances to be there, Charles Pruett, an administrator at Georgetown University, postponed a trip to Los Angeles for New Year's Eve.
''He was a very good and decent man who was called at the right time to serve the country when we needed it most,'' Mr. Pruett said. ''We were very fortunate, and I felt that if I could do anything to at least show a little respect I was going to do so.''

This college town received what it wanted when, during the 1980s and 90s, it sought to reverse the decline of its downtown and to create a more vibrant civic center that would draw people at night and on weekends.
Since then, thousands of young professionals, retirees and former suburbanites have moved to glistening condominium buildings in the shadow of the state Capitol's dome and only a few blocks from the University of Wisconsin's main campus. And there is hardly a bad night for business near State Street, where university students and tourists pack restaurants and bars to capacity even on freezing weeknights.
The revitalization of downtown Madison, Wis., has produced a clash between residents and party crowds.
This college town received what it wanted when, during the 1980s and 90s, it sought to reverse the decline of its downtown and to create a more vibrant civic center that would draw people at night and on weekends.
Since then, thousands of young professionals, retirees and former suburbanites have moved to glistening condominium buildings in the shadow of the state Capitol's dome and only a few blocks from the University of Wisconsin's main campus. And there is hardly a bad night for business near State Street, where university students and tourists pack restaurants and bars to capacity even on freezing weeknights.
But as downtown's population and revelry have grown, so have overcrowding on the streets, vandalism and, most significantly, the police say, alcohol-related crime. Mayor Dave Cieslewicz and other officials find themselves grappling with a problem that is a direct result of Madison's successful transformation: how to tone down downtown.
As an urban issue, the downsizing of downtowns has little precedent because many cities, particularly in the Midwest, are struggling mightily to bring people back to their cores, not send them away.
Of course, many college towns deal with problems related to drinking. In the Midwest alone, La Crosse, Wis., and East Lansing and Ann Arbor, Mich., are struggling with how to cope with the public mayhem often fueled by inebriated students.
In Madison, two Common Council members, convinced that much of what ails downtown can be traced to the proliferation of bars and restaurants known more for drinking than dining, introduced a plan intended to reduce the number of such establishments, and to restrict the approval of new liquor licenses.
The plan, which has the support of Mayor Cieslewicz (pronounced chess-LEV-ich), is preliminary and does not detail, for example, how many or which places may be closed. A final plan is expected to be ready for a Council vote in the spring.
That area of nearly one square mile -- between Lake Mendota, Lake Monona and Blair and Lake Streets -- has 120 places that serve only or mostly alcohol. They have a capacity of more than 11,000 people, city officials said.
The proposal has its critics, many of whom call it nothing less than modern-day Prohibition, and an assault on personal freedom and the free market that flies in the face of Madison's traditional liberalism and Wisconsin's entrenched drinking culture.
Some Council members say they worry that limiting the number of bars will only increase the number of drinkers who turn to house parties and makeshift taverns, where binge drinking and bad behavior often go together but behind closed doors.
''A lot of the activists on this issue revile alcohol, and their logic is equally fallacious as the original Prohibitionists','' said Austin King, the president of the Common Council and a member of its Progressive caucus. ''From a safety perspective,'' Mr. King said, ''I would much, much rather have young people drinking in the regulated environment of bars.''
College students, not surprisingly, also oppose the plan. ''A proportion of students drink irresponsibly, but the majority don't,'' said Katrina Schleitwiler, 21, a political science major at the University of Wisconsin. ''This would just drive students into other places to drink and not affect the problem at all.''
Although Ms. Schleitwiler acknowledged a spate of crimes around campus and downtown, she said she did not think alcohol abuse by students or anyone else was at its root. ''Madison is becoming a big city with more crime,'' she said. ''How different is that from any other city?''
The police see things differently. According to a recent police department analysis of attacks in which someone was injured downtown, about 75 percent of the victims and perpetrators were intoxicated. The analysis also found that after midnight on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, police officers, paramedics and firefighters often spent half to all of their working hours responding to alcohol-fueled fights and disorderly conduct. Noise, public urination and vandalism are constant concerns.
The University of Wisconsin has tried many initiatives to curtail under-age drinking and older students' overconsumption. Most recently, the city and the college jointly paid for a municipal alcohol policy coordinator -- referred to as the ''bar czar'' -- to redouble those efforts. ''Frankly, nothing has worked very well, and there's still a culture of binge drinking,'' Mayor Cieslewicz said.
For the last five years, Madison, formerly a sleepy college town, has grown by about 2,500 people a year into a medium-size city with a population of about 230,000. In the last decade, 1,950 apartments -- rental and condominium units -- have been built downtown.
But the arrival of so many newcomers has produced a culture clash.
Stefanie Moritz, a retired librarian, moved with her husband from Phoenix into a downtown condominium about three years ago, drawn by pedestrian-friendly streets, a university job for her husband and the community's progressive politics.
''We decided that we definitely wanted to live downtown, so we could get rid of one of our cars, my husband could walk to work and we could enjoy the downtown experience,'' Ms. Moritz said. ''The reality is a little bit different.''
She said she quickly grew irritated at being awakened at 2:30 a.m., when the noisy bar crowd usually begins to make its way home, dropping empty beer cans and other trash along the way. One morning she woke to find that garbage had been torched and the flames had charred a tree.
''I want to live downtown, but I also want a decent quality of life,'' Ms. Moritz said. ''And I feel that that is being denied by the present level of alcohol use.''
About 18 months ago, Ms. Moritz became active in a relatively new residents' group, Capitol Neighborhoods, which is at the forefront of the push for stricter drinking rules.
Hawk Schenkel, the owner of one of the biggest restaurants on State Street, Hawk's Bar and Grill, pointed out that residents who criticized the downtown scene had ''moved downtown in a university town.''
''Do they know where all the revenue comes from downtown, why we have a downtown that's alive and worth being in?'' Mr. Schenkel asked. ''All that could change.''
''If the ordinance as written were to pass, my bar would automatically be worth at least $100,000 more, overnight, and it's clear that I personally stand to gain financially,'' he said. ''But I'm against this on principle, and I don't think it helps the problem. My argument is that there aren't enough bars. It's the overcrowding that leads to violence.''

Re ''Saddam Hussein Hanged in Baghdad; Swift End to Drama; Troops on Alert'' (front page, Dec. 30):
As hard as it is to mourn Saddam Hussein, his hurried execution raises a number of disquieting questions.
Was the trial fair?
The statements of President Bush on the subject are hardly reassuring, as they come from a man who supports detention without due process and who considers torture a legitimate interrogation method.
What will the repercussions of this execution worldwide be? Will it encourage the most brutal dictators of the world to hang on to their power by all means to avoid certain execution once they are deposed?
More generally, does revenge through the death penalty bring closure, or does it elicit more revenge and more violence, initiating a spiral of hatred that no human force may be able to stop?
I am afraid that the execution of Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with justice and was carried out only to satisfy the hatred he inspired in most of us.
This is a lame excuse to take any life, including Saddam Hussein's.
Lodovico Balducci  Tampa, Fla., Dec. 30, 2006
To the Editor:
Justice in a show trial conducted by conquerors is a joke.
And even assuming that Saddam Hussein was guilty of the crimes laid at his door, the cost of putting him to death is unacceptably high, since it adds to our sorry image in the Middle East as violent, self-serving intruders.
Mary R. Holbrow  Cambridge, Mass., Dec. 30, 2006
To the Editor:
Re ''Saddam Hussein, Defiant Dictator Who Ruled Iraq With Violence and Fear'' (obituary, Dec. 30):
You write, ''The despot, known as Saddam, had oppressed Iraq for more than 30 years, unleashing devastating regional wars and reducing his once promising, oil-rich nation to a claustrophobic police state.''
This simple statement illustrates why the invasion of Iraq and the complete elimination of Saddam Hussein and his regime was necessary, regardless of the Bush administration's ''true'' motivation for the invasion or its incompetence in controlling the situation and in providing aid and security to the people of Iraq.
No self-respecting humanitarian should raise his head if he opposed the war knowing what Saddam Hussein was responsible for. And what he would surely be doing today if still in power regardless of all the sanctions, diplomacy and United Nations debates.

Saddam Hussein may have deserved it, but we didn't.
By we, I mean the American people, who were forced into being accomplices in the show trial and barbaric execution of Saddam Hussein.
Most civilized countries denounced this execution, and even Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain had voiced misgivings.
Paul E. Harmeier  Darien, Conn., Dec. 30, 2006
To the Editor:
Saddam Hussein has finally received his reward for crimes committed as a dictator, and all it has cost the United States (so far) is nearly 3,000 military deaths, tens of thousands of Americans wounded, hundreds of billions of dollars and international credibility.
This tally, when added to the staggering Iraqi death toll from collateral damage and sectarian violence, might provoke a reasonable person to ask whether there is a price that is too high to pay for planting a seed of democracy in a very resistant soil.
Buck Rutledge  Knoxville, Tenn., Dec. 30, 2006
To the Editor:
As a person who strongly objects to the death penalty, I cannot understand why we were subjected to the vivid portrayal of the hanging of Saddam Hussein.
I feel for the young people who saw such images in their fresh and untainted minds. This execution by hanging reminiscent of the Middle Ages is not helping them consider other kinds of punishment.
What do we say to young people: ''Saddam Hussein killed a lot of people in his country so we're punishing him by hanging''? Don't we stoop to the level of the criminals when we want retribution?
Life is God's creation; so with death. It's not for men to do.
Priscilla V. Dizon  Seattle, Dec. 30, 2006
To the Editor:
The hanging of Saddam Hussein is a watershed in modern Arab history and Arab-American relations.
Two things about it will be remembered by all:
It would have been impossible without the American invasion, conquest and occupation of Iraq; and it was achieved by and through the following chain of events:
Saddam Hussein's being captured and held by American occupation forces; being tried by a court of controversial, if not dubious, legitimacy appointed and approved by the American authorities; and being executed by American encouragement, prodding and certain approval.
The act and the events that eventually led to the execution were undertaken and met with the approval of the majority of Arab officialdom and the rejection and disapproval of the majority of Arab public and popular opinion.
Another landmark event in Arab-American relations.

Last Wednesday morning at my house, one of my daughters back from college was staying at a friend's house in the city, no doubt getting alerts on her cellphone for new postings to her Facebook page. Her sister got up, skipped breakfast and checked the mail for her NetFlix movies. My wife left early before the papers even arrived to commute to her job in the city while listening to the iPod she got for Christmas.
True enough, my 10-year-old gave me five minutes over a bowl of Cheerios, but then she went into the dining room and opened the laptop to surf the Disney Channel on broadband, leaving me standing in the kitchen with my four newspapers. A few of those included news about the sale of The Star Tribune, a newspaper that found itself in reduced circumstances and sold at a reduced price to a private equity group.
I looked around me and realized I didn't really need to read the papers to know why.
Sure, the consolidation of department stores and the flight of classified ads to the Web hurt big metropolitan dailies like The Star Tribune. This summer's downturn in overall newspaper advertising landed hard on the paper, with ads off 6.1 percent in the last year from the year before.
The McClatchy Company, which bought the paper's parent company with a great deal of fanfare in 1998 for $1.2 billion, looked at those numbers -- and the fact that it had lost 26,000 or so daily readers since it bought the paper -- and decided to sell the paper for $530 million. The chain was equally bullish when it bought Knight Ridder for $4.5 billion last summer and then turned around and sold 12 of the papers, including another newspaper in the Twin Cities, The Pioneer Press in St. Paul.
But the sale of The Star Tribune came completely out of the blue, in part because, as the chain's biggest paper, it was viewed as a marquee property. The parties were able to keep it quiet in part because they all knew each other. The principals for the buyers, Avista Capital Partners, were once a part of a private equity arm of Credit Suisse, which represented McClatchy in the sale.
McClatchy's chief executive, Gary B. Pruitt, said that tax advantages of $160 million made it a good time to sell, partly to offset capital gains from the sale of the Knight Ridder papers. When the stealth auction for the paper ended and word of the sale came out the day after Christmas, Mr. Pruitt said, ''I don't feel good about the paper being sold.''
Me either. The paper, around in one version or another since 1867, may not have knocked down a lot of Pulitzers, but with its vigorous political reporting and thoughtful cultural coverage, it has served as a center for civic life in Minneapolis and beyond. The Star Tribune was not a great paper, but then my first car, a very used '64 Ford Falcon, wasn't great either. I still have a great deal of affection for both.
There are two ways to look at the sale: the second-biggest newspaper operator in the country, with its stock dropping in the wake of the Knight Ridder deal, dumped a paper with near 20 percent profit margins in what looked like a fire sale because big papers are doomed. Or, more brightly, a private equity firm saw an opportunity for a savvy investor who could operate the property without the quarter-to-quarter franticness that comes with making Wall Street happy.
It is a cliché of the media business that the assets go up and down the elevator every day. In Minneapolis, many of those assets are pals from my days of working as a reporter and editor at a weekly there, so I wondered: Who would be controlling their professional destinies, bottom feeders or benefactors?
Private equity owners are often viewed with suspicion, in part because they have limited investment horizons and tend to milk properties for cash flow, clean up the balance sheet and then flip the property to what is technically known as a ''greater fool.'' The sale of The Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily News by McClatchy to a local group of investors has resulted, after a sharp downturn this summer, in a great deal of strife and talks of significant layoffs.
I talked to OhSang Kwon, one of the partners in Avista Capital Partners. ''We don't want to rule out anything, but the idea that we bought this paper with a quick exit in mind or that we were going to cut our way to profitability is not correct,'' he said. ''I don't have the hubris to say that we have the answers -- we are new to the newspaper business -- but the old way was not working. Maybe it is time for a different approach.''
Maybe it is. Tomorrow, The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by Dow Jones & Company, will hit my doorstep in a smaller size and with a different approach, pushing much of the so-called commoditized news -- the daily reports and incremental articles that everyone has -- to the Web and filling the physical paper with more analysis and deeper reporting. Google, which has been dining to some degree on ads diverted from newspapers, announced last week that it is expanding a program to sell newspaper advertising using its own auction approach.
As I sat at the kitchen table, I marveled at the low price of a newspaper that had once preoccupied the conversation around my dinner table. Then I looked at the four papers on the table and the empty chairs that surrounded them. Before my second cup of coffee, the rest of my household had already started the day in a way that had nothing to do with the paper artifacts in front of me. Maybe I was the greater fool.

For Sunni Arabs here, the ugly reality of the new Iraq seemed to crystallize in a two-minute segment of Saddam Hussein's hanging, filmed surreptitiously on a cellphone.
The video featured excited taunting of Mr. Hussein by hooded Shiite guards. Passed around from cellphone to cellphone on Sunday, the images had echoes of the videos Sunni militants take of beheadings.
As the Iraqi government becomes ever more set on protecting its Shiite constituency, the goal of stopping the sectarian war seems to be slipping out of reach.
For Sunni Arabs here, the ugly reality of the new Iraq seemed to crystallize in a two-minute segment of Saddam Hussein's hanging, filmed surreptitiously on a cellphone.
The video featured excited taunting of Mr. Hussein by hooded Shiite guards. Passed around from cellphone to cellphone on Sunday, the images had echoes of the videos Sunni militants take of beheadings.
''Yes, he was a dictator, but he was killed by a death squad,'' said a Sunni Arab woman in western Baghdad who was too afraid to give her name. ''What's the difference between him and them?''
There was, of course, a difference. Mr. Hussein was a brutal dictator, while the Shiite organizers of the execution are members of the popularly elected Iraqi government that the United States helped put in place as an attempt to implant a democracy.
It was supposed to be a formal and solemn proceeding carried out by a dispassionate state. But the grainy recording of the execution's cruel theater summed up what has become increasingly clear on the streets of the capital: that the Shiite-led government that assumed power in the American effort here is running the state under an undisguised sectarian banner.
The hanging was hasty. Laws governing its timing were bypassed, and the guards charged with keeping order in the chamber instead disrupted it, shouting Shiite militia slogans.
It was a degrading end for a vicious leader, and an ominous beginning for the new Iraq. The Bush administration has already scaled back its hopes for a democracy here. But as the Iraqi government has become ever more set on protecting its Shiite constituency, often at the expense of the Sunni minority, the goal of stopping the sectarian war seems to be slipping out of reach.
''We speak about the crimes of Saddam Hussein, but now here we are behaving in the same way,'' said Alaa Makki, a prominent Sunni politician. ''We fear that nothing has been changed. On the contrary, we feel it is going in a worse direction.''
After the invasion, Sunni Arabs, bitter at losing their place, refused to take part in Iraq's first elections, allowing Shiites and Kurds to sweep to power. Americans here spent the following months persuading the Shiites to let the Sunnis back in.
The idea, at the time, was that involving Sunnis in politics would drain the insurgency of its violence. Instead, the violence got worse, and in February, the long-abused Shiites struck back, using the force of the state ministries and agencies that they now control.
Now, American officials are pressing Iraqi leaders, both Sunni and Shiite, to reconcile and have made it a central demand for continued support of the Iraqi government. But the prospects for mutual agreement seem ever more distant.
''I can't think of any good reason for any level-minded person to be interested in reconciliation,'' one secular Sunni politician said.
That unwillingness, shared by most of the Shiite political elite, is a serious challenge to any new American strategy proposal that President Bush may announce soon.
Indeed, the Sunni political class is getting smaller. Many of the Sunni politicians once ubiquitous during the broad discussions of the Iraqi Constitution two years ago are now gone. Virtually none of the members of the Association of Muslim Scholars, a hard-line Sunni Arab religious group, are left in Iraq -- most of them have gone to Jordan and Syria. Out of more than 50 members of the Baghdad council that runs the city, only one is Sunni.
The reason is that Shiites, who had been driven from their homes and relentlessly slaughtered by Sunni suicide bombers, are now pushing back. The taunting during Mr. Hussein's execution capped months of advances by Shiite militias, which have forced Sunnis farther back into western Baghdad. But as the Shiites gain the upper hand, they also seem to be abandoning any hint of compromise.
The video, Sunnis said, was a startling symbol of that. In the images, the guards taunt Mr. Hussein. They damn him. They cheer their Shiite heroes so persistently that one observer makes a remark about how the effort to rein in militias does not seem to be going well.
Immediately after they let him drop, in the midst of repeating a prayer, the voices rise in urgency and begin talking excitedly.
Then several others chime in, telling those present to step back from the body and to wait three minutes before touching it.
The video was particularly disturbing for Sunni Arabs, who accuse the government of willfully allowing militias to remain in the ranks of its security forces. It left the impression that the government cared more for revenge than for justice, Sunnis said.
''Either it's terrible incompetence or it's an act of revenge -- a vendetta,'' said Adnan Pachachi, a respected Sunni whose political career began long before Mr. Hussein took power. ''That was the impression people had.''
One of the problems was the timing. The execution was rescheduled a number of times, as Iraqi officials raced through a checklist of requirements put forth by the Americans. Two legal conditions -- that it not be held on a holiday and that the Iraqi president and his two deputies be given 30 days to sign off on the sentence first -- were ignored.
The fact was not lost on Sunni political leaders, including Mr. Makki, who said the execution was a step backward for the country.
''This is a political mistake,'' he said. ''We lost a lot with this.''
To make matters worse, it fell just as the first day of the Id al-Adha holiday dawned for Sunnis -- a day before the Shiites' observance was to begin. Shiite politicians did not apologize and some even reveled in the timing. That did a major disservice to reconciliation, many argued.
''Why couldn't they have waited for a few more days?'' Mr. Pachachi said. ''It was a deliberate insult to so many people. It helped Saddam's friends.''
Yusra Abdul Aziz, a Sunni teacher in Mansour, had a blunter analysis: ''They changed him from a criminal into a martyr.''
In a strange twist, Sunni insurgents did not seem to care. Sunni Jihadist Web sites had virtually no messages about Mr. Hussein's death, aside from two re-released statements, old debates by militant sheiks over whether he should be considered a martyr.
''The feeling is that they don't care about him,'' said Rita Katz, who runs the SITE Institute, a group that tracks militant Islamist Web sites.
For the more hard-line Sunni Arabs, the execution simply confirmed their view that joining the Shiite government could never work. Sheik Hakam Abdullah al-Shahiri from the Obeid tribe in Kirkuk is an example. ''Iraq is occupied now by the U.S. and Iran and a puppet government for both sides,'' he said. ''With the execution of Saddam the Arab identity of Iraq and its unity have ended.''
That has left moderate Sunnis -- those who still seek reconciliation -- to ponder the danger of a Shiite hegemony that seems too scarred from past abuses to govern lightly.
''Governing a country should not be done by reflexes,'' Mr. Makki said. ''It should be wisdom first. A panoramic view.''
''Not behaving from one side,'' he added, ''like what we saw here.''
THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: NEWS ANALYSIS

Confronted with a second, unofficial and more graphic video account of the moments leading up to the execution of Saddam Hussein, and the hanging itself, executives at television news organizations made a series of what one executive, President Steve Capus of NBC News, called ''delicate editorial decisions'' about what they would put on the air on Saturday night and Sunday to augment the first pictures of the execution.
The new video, almost certainly shot by a cellphone camera by one of the guards or witnesses at the execution, includes exchanges between Mr. Hussein and either the witnesses or guards leading up to the moment when the trapdoor opens and he falls. No national American television organization has thus far allowed the moment of the drop to be shown.
A second, more graphic video of Saddam Hussein’s execution left TV news executives to make “delicate editorial decisions” about what to air.

The new video, almost certainly shot by a cellphone camera by one of the guards or witnesses at the execution, includes exchanges between Mr. Hussein and either the witnesses or guards leading up to the moment when the trapdoor opens and he falls. No national American television organization has thus far allowed the moment of the drop to be shown.
But the same niceties were not observed on numerous Web sites, which have posted the complete video, including the moment that Mr. Hussein, noose around his neck, falls, and a close-up of his face afterward. Some prominent sites, like Google's video site and the conservative blog Littlegreenfootballs.com, have posted the complete cellphone coverage of the execution, including the moment Mr. Hussein falls from view.
Fox News and CNN ran the cellphone video -- freezing on Mr. Hussein's face before the final moment -- most of the day on Sunday. Fox was the first to use the video on Saturday evening, after the Arab-language channel Al Jazeera aired it. ABC ran some of the video starting in its late newscasts Saturday night.
David Rhodes, the vice president for news at Fox News, said one reason the network chose to transmit the new video was that it contained the verbal exchanges between Mr. Hussein and those about to put him to death. Most television news executives interviewed Sunday said these hostile exchanges made the new video newsworthy. Jon Klein, the president of CNN's domestic operations, said the flavor of sectarianism cinched the decision. ''It really was a microcosm of the various strains in Iraqi society at the moment,'' he said.

In a 200-page journal, First Sgt. Charles Monroe King prepared his boy for a life without him.
He drew pictures of himself with angel wings. He left a set of his dog tags on a nightstand in my Manhattan apartment. He bought a tiny blue sweat suit for our baby to wear home from the hospital.
Then he began to write what would become a 200-page journal for our son, in case he did not make it back from the desert in Iraq.
For months before my fiancé, First Sgt. Charles Monroe King, kissed my swollen stomach and said goodbye, he had been preparing for the beginning of the life we had created and for the end of his own.
He boarded a plane in December 2005 with two missions, really -- to lead his young soldiers in combat and to prepare our boy for a life without him.
Dear son, Charles wrote on the last page of the journal, ''I hope this book is somewhat helpful to you. Please forgive me for the poor handwriting and grammar. I tried to finish this book before I was deployed to Iraq. It has to be something special to you. I've been writing it in the states, Kuwait and Iraq.
The journal will have to speak for Charles now. He was killed Oct. 14 when an improvised explosive device detonated near his armored vehicle in Baghdad. Charles, 48, had been assigned to the Army's First Battalion, 67th Armored Regiment, Fourth Infantry Division, based in Fort Hood, Tex. He was a month from completing his tour of duty.
For our son's first Christmas, Charles had hoped to take him on a carriage ride through Central Park. Instead, Jordan, now 9 months old, and I snuggled under a blanket in a horse-drawn buggy. The driver seemed puzzled about why I was riding alone with a baby and crying on Christmas Day. I told him.
''No charge,'' he said at the end of the ride, an act of kindness in a city that can magnify loneliness.
On paper, Charles revealed himself in a way he rarely did in person. He thought hard about what to say to a son who would have no memory of him. Even if Jordan will never hear the cadence of his father's voice, he will know the wisdom of his words.
Never be ashamed to cry. No man is too good to get on his knee and humble himself to God.  Follow your heart and look for the strength of a woman.
Charles tried to anticipate questions in the years to come. Favorite team? I am a diehard Cleveland Browns fan. Favorite meal? Chicken, fried or baked, candied yams, collard greens and cornbread. Childhood chores? Shoveling snow and cutting grass. First kiss? Eighth grade.
In neat block letters, he wrote about faith and failure, heartache and hope. He offered tips on how to behave on a date and where to hide money on vacation. Rainy days have their pleasures, he noted: Every now and then you get lucky and catch a rainbow.
Charles mailed the book to me in July, after one of his soldiers was killed and he had recovered the body from a tank. The journal was incomplete, but the horror of the young man's death shook Charles so deeply that he wanted to send it even though he had more to say. He finished it when he came home on a two-week leave in August to meet Jordan, then 5 months old. He was so intoxicated by love for his son that he barely slept, instead keeping vigil over the baby.
I can fill in some of the blanks left for Jordan about his father. When we met in my hometown of Radcliff, Ky., near Fort Knox, I did not consider Charles my type at first. He was bashful, a homebody and got his news from television rather than newspapers (heresy, since I'm a New York Times editor).
But he won me over. One day a couple of years ago, I pulled out a list of the traits I wanted in a husband and realized that Charles had almost all of them. He rose early to begin each day with prayers and a list of goals that he ticked off as he accomplished them. He was meticulous, even insisting on doing my ironing because he deemed my wrinkle-removing skills deficient. His rock-hard warrior's body made him appear tough, but he had a tender heart.
He doted on Christina, now 16, his daughter from a marriage that ended in divorce. He made her blush when he showed her a tattoo with her name on his arm. Toward women, he displayed an old-fashioned chivalry, something he expected of our son. Remember who taught you to speak, to walk and to be a gentleman, he wrote to Jordan in his journal. These are your first teachers, my little prince. Protect them, embrace them and always treat them like a queen.
Though as a black man he sometimes felt the sting of discrimination, Charles betrayed no bitterness. It's not fair to judge someone by the color of their skin, where they're raised or their religious beliefs, he wrote. Appreciate people for who they are and learn from their differences.
He had his faults, of course. Charles could be moody, easily wounded and infuriatingly quiet, especially during an argument. And at times, I felt, he put the military ahead of family.
He had enlisted in 1987, drawn by the discipline and challenges. Charles had other options -- he was a gifted artist who had trained at the Art Institute of Chicago -- but felt fulfilled as a soldier, something I respected but never really understood. He had a chest full of medals and a fierce devotion to his men.
He taught the youngest, barely out of high school, to balance their checkbooks, counseled them about girlfriends and sometimes bailed them out of jail. When he was home in August, I had a baby shower for him. One guest recently reminded me that he had spent much of the evening worrying about his troops back in Iraq.
Charles knew the perils of war. During the months before he went away and the days he returned on leave, we talked often about what might happen. In his journal, he wrote about the loss of fellow soldiers. Still, I could not bear to answer when Charles turned to me one day and asked, ''You don't think I'm coming back, do you?'' We never said aloud that the fear that he might not return was why we decided to have a child before we planned a wedding, rather than risk never having the chance.
But Charles missed Jordan's birth because he refused to take a leave from Iraq until all of his soldiers had gone home first, a decision that hurt me at first. And he volunteered for the mission on which he died, a military official told his sister, Gail T. King. Although he was not required to join the resupply convoy in Baghdad, he believed that his soldiers needed someone experienced with them. ''He would say, 'My boys are out there, I've got to go check on my boys,' '' said First Sgt. Arenteanis A. Jenkins, Charles's roommate in Iraq.
In my grief, that decision haunts me. Charles's father faults himself for not begging his son to avoid taking unnecessary risks. But he acknowledges that it would not have made a difference. ''He was a born leader,'' said his father, Charlie J. King. ''And he believed what he was doing was right.''
Back in April, after a roadside bombing remarkably similar to that which would claim him, Charles wrote about death and duty.
The 18th was a long, solemn night, he wrote in Jordan's journal. We had a memorial for two soldiers who were killed by an improvised explosive device. None of my soldiers went to the memorial. Their excuse was that they didn't want to go because it was depressing. I told them it was selfish of them not to pay their respects to two men who were selfless in giving their lives for their country.
Things may not always be easy or pleasant for you, that's life, but always pay your respects for the way people lived and what they stood for. It's the honorable thing to do.
When Jordan is old enough to ask how his father died, I will tell him of Charles's courage and assure him of Charles's love. And I will try to comfort him with his father's words.
God blessed me above all I could imagine, Charles wrote in the journal. I have no regrets, serving your country is great.
He had tucked a message to me in the front of Jordan's journal. This is the letter every soldier should write, he said. For us, life will move on through Jordan. He will be an extension of us and hopefully everything that we stand for.  I would like to see him grow up to be a man, but only God knows what the future holds.

Jordan W. Hess was the unlikeliest of soldiers.
He could bench-press 300 pounds and then go home and write poetry. He learned the art of glass blowing because it seemed interesting and built a computer with only a magazine as his guide. Most recently, he fell in love with a woman from Brazil and took up digital photography, letting both sweep his heart away.
Specialist Hess, the seventh of eight children, was never keen on premonitions, but on Christmas of 2005, as his tight-knit family gathered on a beach for the weekend, he told each sibling and parent privately that he did not expect to come home from Iraq.
On Nov. 11, Specialist Hess, 26, freshly arrived in Iraq, was conducting a mission as the driver of an Abrams tank when an improvised explosive device, or I.E.D., blew up with brain-rattling force. The blast was so potent it penetrated the 67-ton tank, flinging him against the top and critically injuring his spine. His four crewmates survived. For three weeks, he hung on at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, long enough to utter a few words to his loved ones and absorb their kindness.
On Dec. 4, Specialist Hess slipped onto the ever-expanding list of American military fatalities in Iraq, one that has increased by an average of more than three a day since Oct. 1, the highest three-month toll in two years. On Sunday, with the announcement of the death in Baghdad of Specialist Dustin R. Donica, 22, of Spring, Tex., the list reached the somber milestone of at least 3,000 deaths since the March 2003 invasion.
The landmark reflects how much more dangerous and muddled a soldier's job in Iraq has become in the face of a growing and increasingly sophisticated insurgency. Violence in the country is at an all-time high, according to a Pentagon report released last month. December was the third deadliest month for American troops since the start of the war, with insurgents claiming 111 soldiers' lives. October and November also witnessed a high number of casualties, 106 and 68 respectively, as American forces stepped up combat operations to try to stabilize Baghdad.
''It escalated while I was there,'' said Capt. Scott Stanford, a National Guard officer who was a commander of a headquarters company in Ramadi for a year, arriving in June 2005. ''When we left this June, it was completely unhinged. There was a huge increase in the suicide car bombs we had. The I.E.D.'s were bigger and more complex.''
''And it was very tense before we left in terms of snipers,'' said Captain Stanford, a member of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. ''I don't know if there were more of them, or if they were getting better.''
This spike in violence, which has been felt most profoundly by Iraqi civilians, who are dying by the thousands, has stoked feverish debate about the nation's presence in Iraq. Many Democrats in Congress are urging a phased withdrawal from the country, and the Bush administration is leaning toward deploying additional troops in 2007. If the conflict continues into March, the Iraq war will be the third longest in American history, ranked behind the Vietnam War and the American Revolution.
President Bush did not specifically acknowledge reaching the milestone of 3,000 American deaths, but a White House spokesman, Scott Stanzel, said the president ''grieves for each one that is lost'' and would ensure that their sacrifices were not made in vain. The campaign against terrorism, Mr. Stanzel said, will be a long struggle.
Specialist Hess had volunteered for his mission to spare another soldier the danger of going outside the wire that day. Like so many of his fallen comrades, he had become the victim of an inescapably dangerous roadside landscape.
''It was the type of injury you rarely recover from; in past wars you wouldn't have gotten out of theater,'' said his father, Bill Hess, a Boeing engineer and retired Air Force man. ''So that was a blessing, that he could talk to us. He mouthed words and we were able to say we loved him. There is a lot to be said for that.''
A Steady Toll of Deaths
In many ways, the third 1,000 men and women to die in Iraq faced the same unflinching challenge as the second 1,000 soldiers to die there -- a dedicated and ruthless Iraqi insurgency that has exploited the power of roadside bombs to chilling effect. These bombs now cause about half of all American combat deaths and injuries in Iraq.
Over all, the casualty rate has remained relatively steady since 2005, dipping only slightly. It took 14 months for the death toll to jump to 2,000 soldiers from 1,000. It took about two weeks longer for it to rise to 3,000 from 2,000, during the period covering Oct. 25, 2005, to this week.
''It is hugely frustrating, tragic and disappointing that we can't reduce the fatality rate,'' said Michael O'Hanlon, a military analyst for the Brookings Institution.
The service members who died during this latest period fit an unchanging profile. They were mostly white men from rural areas, soldiers so young they still held fresh memories of high school football heroics and teenage escapades. Many men and women were in Iraq for the second or third time. Some were going on their fourth, fifth or sixth deployment.
But in other ways, the situation has changed in the past year. Improvised explosive devices -- the kind that killed Specialist Hess -- have grown deadlier, despite concerted Pentagon efforts and billions of dollars spent trying to counteract them. Insurgents are now more adept at concealing bombs, booby-trapping them and powering them to penetrate well-armored vehicles. They are also scattering more of them along countless roads using myriad triggers and hiding spots -- under garbage and tires, behind guardrails, inside craters.
At the same time, Iraqi citizens have grown less inclined to tip off soldiers to the presence of these bombs. About 1,200 roadside bombs were detonated in August.
The toll of war has fallen most heavily this year on regular Army soldiers, at least 544 of whom died in this group of 1,000, compared with 405 in the last group. This increase was the result of fewer National Guard soldiers and reservists being deployed to Iraq in 2006.
Considering the intensity of the violence in Iraq this year, it is remarkable that the casualty rate did not climb higher, analysts and officers say. Long-awaited improvements in body and vehicle armor have helped protect soldiers, and advances in battlefield medicine have saved many lives. New procedures, like leaving wounds open to prevent infection, and relaying soldiers to hospitals faster than ever, have kept more service members alive. Troops now carry their own tourniquets.
During World War II, 30 percent of all wounded soldiers died of their injuries, a number that dipped to 24 percent during the Vietnam War and then to 9 percent for the Iraq conflict. Though this is a positive development, it also means that more soldiers are coming home with life-changing injuries, including amputations and brain trauma. More than 22,000 soldiers have been wounded in Iraq.
''There is no question that the number of dead should have been far higher,'' said Dr. William Winkenwerder, the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, referring to the Iraqi conflict. ''Some of these blast injuries are very powerful.''
Bombs and bullets are not the only things that can kill soldiers; nearly 20 percent of those who die in Iraq do so outside of combat operations. Sometimes it is the hazard of driving too quickly on badly rutted roads to avoid danger. Humvees, weighted down with armor, can easily flip if maneuvered too quickly. Many of Iraq's roads are not built to hold heavy vehicles, and the ground can give way, tossing multi-ton machines into narrow canals where soldiers have drowned. Helicopters are sometimes strafed by sandstorms or crippled by mechanical malfunctions. Accidents make up two-thirds of the nonhostile deaths.
With so many soldiers carrying so many weapons, unintentional casualties occur, sometimes while handling firearms. Fire from one's own side is another inevitability of war, as is suicide. Since March 2003, 93 soldiers have died from self-inflicted wounds in Iraq.
In a way, these deaths, coming not at the hands of the enemy, but as a consequence of inferior roads and turbulent weather, can be even more difficult for parents to accept. Sometimes they wait months for official reports, since all noncombat deaths must be investigated.
''I don't think I ever thought something like this could happen,'' said Shelley Burnett, whose son, Lance Cpl. Jason K. Burnett, 20, died in May after his tank toppled into a canal. ''We talked a lot about the I.E.D.'s and the dangers out there, but Jason kept saying, 'There is not a whole lot they can do to a tank.' ''
Death at Roadside
Over the last two years, the Pentagon has worked frantically to harden body armor and the armor on its Humvees and other vehicles. And the insurgents in Iraq have responded just as forcefully with deadly innovations in roadside bombs, and a fury of sniper bullets.
The most lethal development is the use of the ''explosively formed penetrators,'' which pierce armor and stay intact when they explode. Roadside bombs are often detonated from a distance -- with garage door openers, for example -- or automatically, from pressure-sensitive devices, like a simple rubber air hose. Motion detectors and infrared devices are also used.
The vast majority of these bombs do not kill soldiers, or even injure them seriously. Four out of five I.E.D.'s that detonate do not cause casualties, an improvement over previous years, the Pentagon says. But those devices that do cause casualties are killing more soldiers. An analysis by The New York Times of military records found that in 2003, the devices accounted for 16 percent of troop fatalities. This year, they accounted for 43 percent. And an increasing number are killing more than one soldier.
''Unfortunately, when there is a fatal I.E.D. attack, there often are multiple wounded and casualties,'' said Christine DeVries, a spokeswoman for the Pentagon's Joint I.E.D. Defeat Organization. ''The enemy has had some success in adapting to what we are doing.''
Lance Cpl. Jon Eric Bowman, 21, affectionate and angel-faced, was typical of many of the soldiers and marines who found their calling in the military. He was raised in rural Dubach, La., far from the razzmatazz of New Orleans, and could not wait to join after the Sept. 11 attacks.
He was first sent to Iraq early in 2005. When he came home later that year, he had changed. Three days before he was set to redeploy this September, he sat with his wife in their truck and talked for six hours.
''He was crying, he was so scared,'' said his wife, Dawn Bowman, 26. ''He was having dreams that he wasn't coming back.''
In fact, Corporal Bowman had been having blackouts, migraines and a tic, new ailments from his time in Iraq, his wife said. The diagnosis was Tourette's syndrome, and he was then told by doctors in in Louisiana that fluid had built up in his brain.
He wound up back in Iraq, anyway. ''They felt he was just trying to get out of Iraq,'' said Johnny Bowman, the corporal's father, of his son's superiors. ''That there was really nothing wrong with him. That's what he told me on the phone.''
Corporal Bowman did not push the issue, feeling guilty about abandoning his fellow marines. On Oct. 9, his Humvee ran across a roadside bomb, killing him instantly. He had been manning the machine gun.
''Jon Eric was not just my only son,'' his father said. ''He was my best friend.''
Lance Cpl. Jeromy D. West, 20, a mortar man who loved to fish as much as he hated to study, was killed on Nov. 25 by a sniper bullet as he stood guard on a roof in Haditha. It was his second deployment.
In December, shortly after word of his death, his family honored his wishes and held a memorial for him on the football field at Hamilton High School, near San Diego, where he had been a star player. A thousand people showed up.
''Everybody liked him,'' his stepfather, Ron Klopf, said. ''People would say, 'God, your son is polite.' And I would say, 'My kid?' I called him Eddie Haskell -- so polite at everybody else's house.''
Corporal West was goofy in the best way. Not long before he joined the Marines, he and his friend would compete to see who could get a bigger freeze headache from eating too much ice cream. They would writhe in pain. Then they would do it again. He was 17 when he decided to get serious and join the corps, something his parents tried to talk him out of.
'' 'You can get killed doing this,' '' Mr. Klopf remembers saying. ''And he said, 'Should we send some other parent's kid out there?' And that's how he was.''
For Corporal Burnett, death came not from bullets or bombs but from riding in a tank in a country crisscrossed with irrigation canals and crumbly roads. Just two years after graduating from high school in St. Cloud, Fla., where he spent his summers building houses for the poor and four-wheeling on back-country roads, Corporal Burnett's tank fell off a bridge and plunged into a canal, in which he drowned.
His mother cannot forget the day Jason and his younger brother tossed her back and forth in the yard to make her scream with laughter. ''He was a fun-loving kid,'' Mrs. Burnett said. ''If you heard laughter, you knew Jason was around.''
Optimism was Specialist Robert F. Weber's indelible quality. A gunner from Cincinnati, he had warned his mother, Cathy, that the roads in Iraq were wretched. She worried a lot during his first deployment, particularly after he sent home a roll of film to develop. The first print she saw was of a missile hitting a barracks.
But he made it back to America and bought a blue Kia, the color of his eyes, before redeploying three weeks later. The Army had been a good fit. ''He was proud of himself,'' she said of Bobby, her only child. ''I was very proud. It was like he found his niche.''
On his second deployment, though, the situation in Iraq had become grimmer. ''Mom, things are getting worse over here, more dangerous,'' he said, from his base near Mosul the Saturday before he died. ''The roads are bad. You don't run over anything even if it looks like a piece of paper.''
But the lumbering armored Humvee he was on never hit a bomb on Sept. 30. It swerved somehow and flipped, killing him.
Mrs. Weber said she cannot imagine seeing the troops walk away from Iraq now, when democracy seems as unattainable as ever. ''For what did all these guys get killed over there?'' she asked, incredulously. ''What for?''
Seven Days from Home
Back in America, countless families and friends have waited and worried and tried their best these past years to keep themselves busy until their husbands, sons, wives, daughters, fathers, mothers or buddies returned home safely. For 3,000 of them, the reunion never came.
In too many cases, the homecoming was tantalizingly near, a few more X's on the calendar and the vigil would be over. A number of soldiers were killed just days and weeks from the end of their deployment, a date close enough to allow those back home to lower their guard a trifle, making the deaths all the more devastating.
''It's almost like Christmas is here, and you wake up Christmas morning and there is no Christmas,'' said Col. Bill Rochelle, a retired National Guard commander of the 42nd Division support command.
Gunnery Sgt. John D. Fry, a 28-year-old marine from Lorena, Tex., was seven days from scooping up his wife, Malia, and his three kids into a group hug back in America. ''My plans,'' Sergeant Fry told his commander, ''are to go home and wrestle with my kids.''
He and Mrs. Fry were only 15 when they went on their first date, to see ''A League of Their Own,'' and then to eat ice cream at the mall. Mom and Dad drove them home. A year later, he plopped her on his lap and proposed. They kept their engagement a secret. Not long after, he was named salutatorian at Heritage Christian Academy. Another student bested him for the top title; it was the future Mrs. Fry, the valedictorian.
''We were soul mates,'' Mrs. Fry said. On Nov. 15, 1995, five days after he graduated from boot camp, they were married.
Mr. Fry, who liked a challenge, specialized in defusing explosive devices, a nerve-racking skill he brought with him to Iraq. ''Babe,'' Mrs. Fry recalled his saying when he chose the specialty, ''it's dangerous, but I want to do it. And I said, 'Let's go.' ''
A team leader, Sergeant Fry, who shipped out to Iraq in September 2005, disarmed 73 bombs, including one of the biggest car bombs found in Falluja. Once he helped defuse a suicide vest that insurgents had belted to a mentally handicapped Iraqi teenage boy. The boy had been beaten and chained to a wall. Another time, he spotted a bomb from the roof of a house. A little boy popped into the yard, hovering dangerously close to it. Sergeant Fry won his confidence by playing peekaboo, then got him to move away.
He was in ''very high spirits'' in March, calling his wife to say that his duties were done, his paperwork filed and his anticipation impossible to stifle. ''He had made it,'' she said. Then a mission came down, and commanders were preparing to send a team of mostly inexperienced men to defuse bombs along a road in Al Anbar province. He volunteered for the job, instead. ''That is how he led,'' Mrs. Fry said.
Sergeant Fry found three bombs that night and defused them. But the insurgents had hidden a fourth bomb under the third one, a booby-trap. It blew up and killed him. An Army team stayed with his body for six hours, fending off enemy fire in the dark until soldiers with mortuary affairs arrived to take his body away.
The war never scared him, Mrs. Fry said.
''It was hard, but he felt he was making a difference,'' she said. ''He believed truly, that if he wasn't over there, they would be trying to harm us here.''
Estimates of Iraqi Civilian Deaths
Unlike the tally for American service members, no official count is available for the number of civilians killed in Iraq. Estimates based on mortuary tallies, news reports and household surveys vary widely.
Using figures provided by the Iraq Ministry of Health, which counts violent deaths at hospitals across the country, and Baghdad's central morgue, the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq has estimated that more than 28,000 Iraqi civilians were killed during the first 10 months of 2006, a number 40 times higher than the number of American service members killed during that time.
The American military has criticized the civilian count as high, but it has not released statistics of its own. In its quarterly reports to Congress, the Pentagon has provided a rough estimate of the number of Iraqi civilians and security forces killed or wounded by insurgents. That number has risen sharply, to an average of more than 90 a day since last May.
In an off-the-cuff estimate during an official visit to Vienna in November, Iraq's health minister, Ali al-Shimari, said that 150,000 Iraqis had been killed in violence since the war began in 2003, the Associated Press has reported.
Iraq Body Count, an independent group that monitors news reports of deaths, has recorded the deaths of more than 52,000 Iraqi civilians.
The highest estimates of the civilian toll come from a team of researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. In a study published in The Lancet, a British medical journal, they estimated 600,000 Iraqis died from violence between March 2003 and July 2006, basing their analysis on a survey of 1,849 households in 47 neighborhoods across Iraq.
That study was widely criticized -- the sample interviewed may not accurately represent the entire country -- but it emphasized both the difficulty of tracking deaths in a war zone and the need for a reliable count.

Eliot Laurence Spitzer takes the oath of office as New York’s 54th governor with a mandate to take on corruption.
Eliot Laurence Spitzer takes the oath of office as New York's 54th governor in a capital desperately in need of a new moral authority figure.
Whether or not he succeeds in fulfilling the soaring expectations that led to his landslide victory, his political timing is fortunate. After making ethical reform one of the central pledges of his campaign, Mr. Spitzer has watched from the sidelines in recent weeks as scandal has engulfed the upper reaches of state government.
''This is a crisis that I don't want to waste,'' Mr. Spitzer said in an interview before he was sworn in early today. [Page B4.] ''If there is a result of this momentary concentration on ethical dilemmas and failures, an opportunity to galvanize support for reform, we better seize it.''
Since the November election, Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, a Democrat, has resigned and pleaded guilty to a felony. The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican, has revealed that federal authorities were investigating his outside consulting work. State Senator Efrain González Jr., a Democrat, has been charged with stealing more than $400,000 in state money. And a state court judge has forced a recalcitrant Legislature to reveal how it spends hundreds of millions of dollars worth of taxpayer funds on pet projects.
In his effort to change the culture of Albany, Mr. Spitzer said that upon taking office, he would issue ''a slew'' of executive orders ''relating to ethics, procurement and the behavior of the leadership in the agencies where a governor has unilateral control.''
The orders will mirror those he recently outlined for his own staff, which included a ban on gifts of more than nominal value and a prohibition on members of the executive branch from lobbying any part of the executive branch for two years after they leave their posts.
More daunting will be his efforts to push lawmakers to pass a number of measures early in the legislative session as he seizes on his landslide victory and the recent corruption scandals to push his agenda.
''He has talked about redistricting reform, he's talked about campaign finance reform, he's talked about ending pay to play and he's talked overall about a transparent and accountable state government,'' said Blair Horner, the legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research Group. ''If he accomplishes all of that, that's probably more reform than we've seen in New York for the last 200 years.''
Mr. Spitzer is trying to reshape a state government notoriously resistant to change. Voters re-elected Mr. Hevesi as their comptroller after he admitted using state employees to chauffeur his wife. And while nearly a dozen lawmakers faced criminal charges in the last few years, many were subsequently re-elected. Mr. Spitzer will probably gain more traction from voters by delivering on his other priorities, including lowering property taxes and revitalizing the upstate economy.
As attorney general, Mr. Spitzer made his name by taking on Wall Street corruption as the bull market of the late 1990s unraveled and the Securities and Exchange Commission had a limited appetite for enforcement, giving him an opening to redefine his job and make himself a nationally known figure.
But he now must learn to work by consensus instead of by subpoena, and close watchers of the Albany scene say Mr. Spitzer must act fast so as not to lose momentum.
Still, while reform proposals have stalled for years in the legislature, lawmakers are aware that Mr. Spitzer was elected by a record margin.
''Right now the Legislature is on its heels,'' Mr. Horner said. ''They know the public and the new governor wants action, and I think the Legislature will want to accommodate him, but if he gets bogged down in the first session, it makes it harder to achieve the things he wants to do.''
Already, Senate Republicans have embraced Mr. Spitzer's proposal to delineate all spending items in the state budget, ending the practice by the Legislature and Gov. George E. Pataki of writing large blank checks into the budget that they could later spend, largely in secret.
Certainly, the new governor has a much more caffeinated style than the old one. There were titters in political circles when Mr. Pataki recently escorted a group of former Republican governors to the Broadway show ''The Drowsy Chaperone.'' The play's title echoed the criticisms frequently lobbed at Mr. Pataki -- that he has been rarely seen or heard in Albany as its problems have festered.
Mr. Spitzer has the on-the-offensive style of a former prosecutor and is well known for rattling rich and powerful cages. He made a campaign slogan of changing Albany ''on Day 1'' of his administration, but sought to set a new tone even earlier. Shortly before the election, he withdrew his endorsement of Mr. Hevesi, even though the two had been close political allies. Mr. Spitzer said that after the election he would begin adhering to a set of campaign finance guidelines far stricter than those required by state law.
There have been, however, some steps that have raised eyebrows, including Mr. Spitzer's appointment of a Cablevision lobbyist to be his new secretary of state. But many of his closest advisers will be veterans of the attorney general's office or of his campaign.
In his inaugural address, Mr. Spitzer will strive to flower his litigator's prose with rhetorical flourishes. Along those lines, he said he would ''hearken back to the great transformations New York has gone through -- the Erie Canal is everybody's favorite metaphor, and there will be some passing reference to it -- and Teddy Roosevelt's effort to bring a new ethic of governance to the capital.''
''The theme of the inaugural speech is clearly going to be that we are turning a corner,'' he said. ''We have to think of ourselves through a different prism, both in terms of ethics and as an entire state. We have to think of ourselves as one New York and not a series of interests that are spoken to, appealed to and mollified.''
Brass tacks will probably wait until Wednesday, when Mr. Spitzer delivers his first address to the Legislature, and until Feb. 1, when his first executive budget is due.
''Somebody told me an inaugural is values, a State of the State is principles and the budget is the bad news,'' he said.
The bad news starts with the multibillion-dollar deficits projected for the state in future years.
''The surplus we had at the end of the year is no different than an advance on a credit card bill that will come due on our next statement,'' he said. ''There is an increasing series of deficits as we proceed to Year 2, 3 and 4. The deficit increases by several billion dollars a year thereafter, and this is a consequence of prior budgets having pushed costs into the out years. That will make it tough, and tough choices have to be made.''
But Mr. Spitzer has some costly promises to keep, and conversely, some politically risky cuts to make. During the campaign, he outlined a complicated set of priorities, including reining in state spending to offset escalating future deficits, but also increasing spending on education and cutting by half the number of New Yorkers without health insurance.
In his speech, he said, he will touch on his three overarching goals.
At the forefront are his plans for ethical reforms, which include exploring changes to the quasi-independent public authorities that control much of the state's spending but act, as he has said, as a ''shadow government'' with little accountability.
A second focus will be investing in the state's infrastructure, including large transportation projects like replacing the Tappan Zee Bridge and building the Second Avenue subway. He also wants the state to take a much more assertive role in creating lower-cost housing.
''We haven't had an aggressive state housing policy for how long?'' he said. ''The state has to participate if we're going to build the housing stock we need.''
Perhaps the most complicated part of his three-pronged agenda is his plan for economic revitalization. Reviving the economy of upstate New York, and particularly the Buffalo area, is of such concern that he split the leadership of the Empire State Development Corporation in half, with leaders for upstate and downstate. He also wants to rein in state spending overall, in part by overhauling the Medicaid system, but also by lowering property taxes and providing relief to businesses on issues like workers' compensation policies. At the same time, he wants to increase education spending by billions of dollars.
With so much to do, he hopes to move quickly.
''Delay is the enemy of progress,'' he said. ''If you do not lay out the agenda early on and lay out the framework for change, we won't get there.''

The Democrats taking over Congress this week are promising sweeping changes to ethics and lobbying laws, pledging to clean up after a spate of corruption scandals under Republican rules.
So far, however, their proposals are not as comprehensive or far-reaching as changes already adopted by many state legislatures.
Plans for reform by Congressional Democrats are less sweeping than changes already adopted by many state legislatures.
The Democrats taking over Congress this week are promising sweeping changes to ethics and lobbying laws, pledging to clean up after a spate of corruption scandals under Republican rules.
So far, however, their proposals are not as comprehensive or far-reaching as changes already adopted by many state legislatures.
Democrats in both chambers are proposing new restrictions on gifts, meals or trips paid for by lobbyists. They say they plan for the first time to require lawmakers to disclose their sponsorship of the pet items known as earmarks that they insert into major bills. House Democrats also want to require members to certify that they will not personally profit from the projects.
Several states, responding to the federal scandals as well as their own statehouse imbroglios, have already adopted more sweeping gift and travel bans, broader measures to end the central role of lobbyists or government contractors in financing campaigns and new public campaign financing intended to reduce lawmakers' dependence on big donors.
To enforce their rules, about half the states have also created independent ethics watchdogs, outside the control of the lawmakers they police -- something federal lawmakers have so far resisted. House Democrats recently said they would create a panel to study the idea.
John Hurson, a former member of the Maryland General Assembly and president of the National Council of State Legislatures, remembers marveling at the goings-on just a few miles away in the United States Capitol. He was barred from letting a lobbyist buy him a cup of coffee under rules enforced by the Maryland Ethics Commission. Meanwhile, congressmen were flying across the country for golf trips with lobbyists and enlisting them as major fund-raisers for their re-election campaigns.
''It was amusing in a sad kind of way,'' said Mr. Hurson, who now works as a Washington lobbyist himself, for a cosmetics industry trade group. ''At the state level in Maryland a lobbyist can't even have his name on a campaign flier. And at the federal level some of these guys are basically running campaigns.''
Democrats say their proposals are significant first steps, especially given the customary opposition of most incumbents toward rules that would restrict their fund-raising edge. The Democrats argue that their proposals go further than anything Republicans managed to pass.
''It is an important step forward from where we have been, let's put it that way,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen, the Maryland Democrat who is taking over the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and is a proponent of several more drastic changes.
Still, some Democrats say they hope the Congress will go beyond the party leaders' current proposals. They argue that their party took control of Congress in part because of backlash against the corruption scandals under the Republicans, that many new members campaigned on ethics reform and that a failure to deliver meaningful changes could hurt the party in the 2008 elections.
Lawmakers say the Supreme Court made it difficult to regulate campaign spending by ruling in 1976, in Buckley v. Valeo, that it is a protected form of free expression.
States, however, are testing the limits of that decision.
More than a dozen states, including New Jersey and Connecticut, have enacted so-called pay-to-play laws that block contractors or executives of their companies from making campaign contributions to officials who could influence state contracts.
Connecticut, reeling from a payoff scandal that unseated its governor, recently passed a pay-to-play law that takes aim at a time-tested tactic for evading contribution limits: funneling money through dependents. The law bans campaign contributions not only from lobbyists and contracting executives but also from their children and spouses. To make enforcement easier, lobbyists and contractors would be required to disclose the names of their family members on a public Web site. (No Congressional proposal does the same.)
On Tuesday, a federal district court judge in Connecticut will hear a challenge to the law.
Connecticut has also borrowed some aspects of a decade-old Maryland law that seeks to restrict the most valuable gift that lobbyists give lawmakers: campaign fund-raising.
At the federal level, caps on individual or corporate campaign contributions have placed a premium on ''bundlers,'' who solicit and collect donations to turn over in bulk to a candidate's campaign.
Many Washington lobbyists are among the biggest bundlers, and even help run re-election campaigns.
Across the District of Columbia border in Maryland, state law bars lobbyists from soliciting contributions for candidates or playing any roles in the campaigns.
''Lobbyists can no longer be the center of the fund-raising process,'' Mr. Van Hollen of Maryland said.
Mr. Van Hollen said he planned to introduce a measure requiring federal lobbyists to disclose whom they ask for the contributions that they bundle and how much those people give. A similar measure was deleted from a bill by the Republican leadership before it reached the floor.
States are also adopting new forms of public campaign financing.
Congressional candidates receive no public financing, and there is no limit on what they can spend. And the public financing system adopted for presidential campaigns after the Watergate scandal is on the brink of obsolescence. For the first time in three decades, the major 2008 presidential candidates are expected to reject the system in favor of raising unlimited private funds.
Several states, however, are expanding the idea. Maryland and New Jersey are among those considering a system enacted in Arizona and Maine. The new Connecticut law includes a modified form of the idea, known as ''clean elections.''
Participating candidates who get a certain amount of small contributions -- as low as $5 in some places -- receive large lump sums of public campaign money early in the race if they agree not to raise or spend private funds. And, up to a limit, the state pledges to give participating candidates enough money to match the campaign spending of any rival candidate outside the system.
No state, of course, has eradicated the influence of money. In Maryland, for example, lobbyists cannot take individual lawmakers to dinner but can treat whole legislative committees, a rule lobbyists say favors the well-financed. Even so, some Annapolis lobbyists appreciate the fund-raising ban.
''Legislators can call and say they need your help,'' said Minor Carter, a Republican lobbyist. ''And you have the absolute defense of saying, 'I'm sorry, I can't.' ''

With his plain pine coffin strapped into an American military helicopter for a predawn journey across the desert, Saddam Hussein, the executed dictator who built a legend with his defiance of America, completed a turbulent passage into history on Sunday.
Like the helicopter trip, just about everything in the 24 hours that began with Mr. Hussein's being taken to his execution from his cell in an American military detention center in the postmidnight chill of Saturday had a surreal and even cinematic quality.
American officials are said to have questioned the political wisdom of expediting the execution of Saddam Hussein.
With his plain pine coffin strapped into an American military helicopter for a predawn journey across the desert, Saddam Hussein, the executed dictator who built a legend with his defiance of America, completed a turbulent passage into history on Sunday.
Like the helicopter trip, just about everything in the 24 hours that began with Mr. Hussein's being taken to his execution from his cell in an American military detention center in the postmidnight chill of Saturday had a surreal and even cinematic quality.
Part of it was that the Americans, who turned him into a pariah and drove him from power, proved to be his unlikely benefactors in the face of Iraq's new Shiite rulers who seemed bent on turning the execution and its aftermath into a new nightmare for the Sunni minority privileged under Mr. Hussein. [Page A7.]
The 110-mile journey aboard a Black Hawk helicopter carried Mr. Hussein's body to an American military base north of Tikrit, Camp Speicher, named for an American Navy pilot lost over Iraq in the first hours of the Persian Gulf war in 1991. From there, an Iraqi convoy carried him to Awja, the humble town beside the Tigris River that Mr. Hussein, in the chandeliered palaces that became his habitat as ruler, spoke of as emblematic of the miseries of his lonely and impoverished youth.
The American role extended beyond providing the helicopter that carried Mr. Hussein home. Iraqi and American officials who have discussed the intrigue and confusion that preceded the decision late on Friday to rush Mr. Hussein to the gallows have said that it was the Americans who questioned the political wisdom -- and justice -- of expediting the execution, in ways that required Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki to override constitutional and religious precepts that might have assured Mr. Hussein a more dignified passage to his end.
The Americans' concerns seem certain to have been heightened by what happened at the hanging, as evidenced in video recordings made just before Mr. Hussein fell through the gallows trapdoor at 6:10 a.m. on Saturday. A new video that appeared on the Internet late Saturday, apparently made by a witness with a camera cellphone, underscored the unruly, mocking atmosphere in the execution chamber.
This continued, on the video, through the actual hanging itself, with a shout of ''The tyrant has fallen! May God curse him!'' as Mr. Hussein hung lifeless, his neck snapped back and his glassy eyes open.
The cacophony from those gathered before the gallows included a shout of ''Go to hell!'' as the former ruler stood with the noose around his neck in the final moments, and his riposte, barely audible above the bedlam, which included the words ''gallows of shame.'' It continued despite appeals from an official-sounding voice, possibly Munir Haddad, the judge who presided at the hanging, saying, ''Please no! The man is about to die.''
The Shiites who predominated at the hanging began a refrain at one point of ''Moktada! Moktada! Moktada!''-- the name of a volatile cleric whose private militia has spawned death squads that have made an indiscriminate industry of killing Sunnis -- appending it to a Muslim imprecation for blessings on the Prophet Muhammad. ''Moktada,'' Mr. Hussein replied, smiling contemptuously. ''Is this how real men behave?''
American officials in Iraq have been reluctant to say much publicly about the pell-mell nature of the hanging, apparently fearful of provoking recriminations in Washington, where the Bush administration adopted a hands-off posture, saying the timing of the execution was Iraq's to decide.
While privately incensed at the dead-of-night rush to the gallows, the Americans here have been caught in the double bind that has ensnared them over much else about the Maliki government -- frustrated at what they call the government's failure to recognize its destructive behavior, but reluctant to speak out, or sometimes to act, for fear of undermining Mr. Maliki and worsening the situation.
But a narrative assembled from accounts by various American officials, and by Iraqis present at some of the crucial meetings between the two sides, shows that it was the Americans who counseled caution in the way the Iraqis carried out the hanging. The issues uppermost in the Americans' minds, these officials said, were a provision in Iraq's new Constitution that required the three-man presidency council to approve hangings, and a stipulation in a longstanding Iraqi law that no executions can be carried out during the Id al-Adha holiday, which began for Iraqi Sunnis on Saturday and Shiites on Sunday.
A senior Iraqi official said the Americans staked out their ground at a meeting on Thursday, 48 hours after an appeals court had upheld the death sentence passed on Mr. Hussein and two associates. They were convicted in November of crimes against humanity for the persecution of the Shiite townspeople of Dujail, north of Baghdad, in 1982. Mr. Hussein, as president, signed a decree to hang 148 men and teenage boys.
Told that Mr. Maliki wanted to carry out the death sentence on Mr. Hussein almost immediately, and not wait further into the 30-day deadline set by the appeals court, American officers at the Thursday meeting said that they would accept any decision but needed assurance that due process had been followed before relinquishing physical custody of Mr. Hussein.
''The Americans said that we have no issue in handing him over, but we need everything to be in accordance with the law,'' the Iraqi official said. ''We do not want to break the law.''
The American pressure sent Mr. Maliki and his aides into a frantic quest for legal workarounds, the Iraqi official said. The Americans told them they needed a decree from President Jalal Talabani, signed jointly by his two vice presidents, upholding the death sentence, and a letter from the chief judge of the Iraqi High Tribunal, the court that tried Mr. Hussein, certifying the verdict. But Mr. Talabani, a Kurd, made it known that he objected to the death penalty on principle.
The Maliki government spent much of Friday working on legal mechanisms to meet the American demands. From Mr. Talabani, they obtained a letter saying that while he would not sign a decree approving the hanging, he had no objections. The Iraqi official said Mr. Talabani first asked the tribunal's judges for an opinion on whether the constitutional requirement for presidential approval applied to a death sentence handed down by the tribunal, a special court operating outside Iraq's main judicial system. The judges said the requirement was void.
Mr. Maliki had one major obstacle: the Hussein-era law proscribing executions during the Id holiday. This remained unresolved until late Friday, the Iraqi official said. He said he attended a late-night dinner at the prime minister's office at which American officers and Mr. Maliki's officials debated the issue.
One participant described the meeting this way: ''The Iraqis seemed quite frustrated, saying, 'Who is going to execute him, anyway, you or us?' The Americans replied by saying that obviously, it was the Iraqis who would carry out the hanging. So the Iraqis said, 'This is our problem and we will handle the consequences. If there is any damage done, it is we who will be damaged, not you.' ''
To this, the Iraqis added what has often been their trump card in tricky political situations: they telephoned officials of the marjaiya, thesupreme religious body in Iraqi Shiism, composed of ayatollahs in the holy city of Najaf. The ayatollahs approved. Mr. Maliki, at a few minutes before midnight on Friday, then signed a letter to the justice minister, ''to carry out the hanging until death.''
The Maliki letter sent Iraqi and American officials into a frenzy of activity. Fourteen Iraqi officials, including senior members of the Maliki government, were called at 1:30 a.m. on Saturday and told to gather at the prime minister's office. At. 3:30 a.m., they were driven to the helicopter pad beside Mr. Hussein's old Republican Palace, and taken to the prison in the northern suburb of Khadimiya where the hanging took place.
At about the same time, American and Iraqi officials said, Mr. Hussein was roused at his Camp Cropper cell 10 miles away, and taken to a Black Hawk helicopter for his journey to Khadimiya.
None of the Iraqi officials were able to explain why Mr. Maliki had been unwilling to allow the execution to wait. Nor would any explain why those who conducted it had allowed it to deteriorate into a sectarian free-for-all that had the effect, on the video recordings, of making Mr. Hussein, a mass murderer, appear dignified and restrained, and his executioners, representing Shiites who were his principal victims, seem like bullying street thugs.
But the explanation may have lain in something that Bassam al-Husseini, a Maliki aide closely involved in arrangements for the hanging, said to the BBC later. Mr. Husseini, who has American citizenship, described the hanging as ''an Id gift to the Iraqi people.''
The weekend's final disorderly chapter came with the tensions over Mr. Hussein's body. For nearly 18 hours on Saturday, Mr. Maliki's officials insisted that his corpse would be kept in secret government custody until circumstances allowed interment without his grave becoming a shrine or a target. Once again, the Americans intervened.
The leader of Mr. Hussein's Albu-Nasir tribe, Sheik Ali al-Nida, said that before flying to Baghdad on an American helicopter, he had been so fearful for his safety that he had written a will. Bizarrely, Sheik Nida and others were shown on Iraqi television collecting the coffin from the courtyard in front of Mr. Maliki's office, where it sat unceremoniously in a police pickup.
After the helicopter trip to Camp Speicher, the American base outside Tikrit, the coffin was taken in an Iraqi convoy to Awja, and laid to rest in the ornate visitors' center that Mr. Hussein ordered built for the townspeople in the 1990s. Local officials and members of Mr. Hussein's tribe had broken open the marbled floor in the main reception hall, and cleared what they said would be a temporary burial place until he could be moved to a permanent grave outside Awja where his two sons, Uday and Qusay, are buried.
At the burial, several mourners threw themselves on the closed casket. One, a young man convulsed with sobs, cried: ''He has not died. I can hear him speaking to me.'' Another shouted, ''Saddam is dead! Instead of weeping for him, think of ways we can take revenge on the Iranian enemy,'' Sunni parlance for the Shiites now in power.

It may fall short of a feel-good sequel to ''Chinatown,'' the movie based on the notorious, somewhat shady water grab by Los Angeles that allowed the city to bloom from a semi-arid desert.
But in one of the largest river restoration efforts in the West, water is again flowing along a 62-mile stretch of the Owens River after a dry spell of nearly a century.
A river restoration is among the steps the city is taking to redress the environmental effects of its water policies.
It may fall short of a feel-good sequel to ''Chinatown,'' the movie based on the notorious, somewhat shady water grab by Los Angeles that allowed the city to bloom from a semi-arid desert.
But in one of the largest river restoration efforts in the West, water is again flowing along a 62-mile stretch of the Owens River after a dry spell of nearly a century.
That part of the river had been left mostly drained when upstream water, fed by snowmelt from the towering Sierra Nevada, was channeled 233 miles south to fill swimming pools and bathtubs throughout Los Angeles.
The restored flow is among several long-awaited steps the city is taking to help make amends for the environmental consequences of its water maneuvering, most notably the drying up of Owens Lake, an area more than three times the size of Manhattan, here in the Owens Valley.
Los Angeles agreed in December to expand efforts to control toxic dust storms that erupt from what is left of the lake, a 110-square-mile body that emptied when the river was diverted to Los Angeles through an aqueduct opened in 1913.
The lake's salty, mineral-laced basin has been the largest single source of particulate pollution in the country. It looks so otherworldly that it doubled as a desolate planet in the movie ''Star Trek V: The Final Frontier.''
To restore the river, Los Angeles built automated gates at the point where the river veers into the aqueduct. The gates steer some water into the original riverbed, setting the stage for the growth of cottonwood trees and other plants and the return of waterfowl and other animals.
Much of the water eventually returns to the aqueduct, though some of it is being used for lake irrigation and other projects.
Environmentalists here say they are keeping an eye on Los Angeles for backsliding, but they acknowledge that the new efforts will make a significant difference.
As winds whipped across Owens Lake on a recent afternoon, Mike Prather of the Owens Valley Committee, which along with the Sierra Club took Los Angeles to court over the environmental fallout of its water policies, marveled at sandpipers, American avocets and other birds frolicking in the shallow pools created by the irrigation.
''This work will bring back more and more of them,'' Mr. Prather said, savoring the twist in the battle that means water once intended for Los Angeles will feed the lake.
''It's Owens Valley's turn to stick its straw in L.A.'s water,'' he said.
Court rulings and the threat of legal action have largely forced Los Angeles's hand in dealing with its past water moves, but city leaders say they are also intent on doing the right thing in keeping up a vital source of water while avoiding further damage to the Owens Valley.
H. David Nahai, president of the board that oversees the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, said Los Angeles was looking for less adversarial ways to resolve differences over the valley, which provides 40 percent to 60 percent of the city's water supply, depending on the snowfall in the mountains.
''We can't change the past, but we can shape the future,'' said Mr. Nahai, one of five board members appointed by Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa, who promised a friendlier approach to the valley when he took office in July 2005.
Susan Cash, the chairwoman of the Board of Supervisors of Inyo County, where the Owens Valley is located, said animosity toward Los Angeles had lessened since the early 20th century, when the water diversion was made possible by the purchase of much of the valley by less-than-forthcoming city operatives.
The underhanded moves, as chronicled by historians, included city representatives posing as ranchers as they bought up property. The questionable land dealing provided the inspiration for ''Chinatown,'' the 1974 movie starring Jack Nicholson as a private detective who stumbles across corruption on a Los Angeles water project.
Water from the valley made possible the growth of what became the nation's second-largest city. But people in the valley have long regarded the water dealings as a double-edged sword.
Officials here have argued that the water diversion undercut the potential for growth. But others say that such prospects were dim anyway in such a dry and remote valley, and that Los Angeles's keeping the water clean and the land relatively untouched has been a boon.
Los Angeles's policy of allowing public access to much of its land and the fact that many people here have worked for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, one of the valley's largest employers, or have friends or relatives there, have contributed to improved relations. The godfathers of Ms. Cash's children worked for the department.
''The fact is,'' she said, ''we are in a marriage with no annulment in the near future, so we have to find a way to work together.''
Inyo officials said the city's projects could inspire more tourism, the only real economic activity in this dry, high-desert valley.
''We have recreational users now but not to the extent it can be once the river is flowing and there is sufficient water for fish and wildlife,'' said Arlene Grider, president of the chamber of commerce here.
The long-promised river restoration is a $24 million project, compensation won from a lawsuit by environmental groups over excessive groundwater pumping. It came after delays that prompted a county judge in September 2005 to impose daily fines of $5,000 on Los Angeles. The penalty has so far cost the city $2.3 million and will continue until a large volume of water flows through the river in the coming months.
The work on the lake, scheduled to be completed by 2010, will irrigate or otherwise control dust over 43 square miles.
The improvements result from an agreement the city signed with the local air pollution control regulator in 1998 that sets a timetable to comply with federal requirements to control dust on the lake. The city has spent $400 million on dust control for just under 30 square miles of the worst pockets, and in December, through a mediator, it agreed to do 12.7 more square miles by 2010 at a cost of $105 million.
A water department spokeswoman in Los Angeles, Carol Tucker, said ratepayers would see relatively modest increases in their monthly bills; the river restoration, for example, would amount to an increase of about 26 cents. Los Angeles has one of the country's more intensive conservation programs, allowing it to use roughly the same amount of water even as it has grown by 750,000 residents in the past two decades.
But environmentalists say they doubt the city can grow much more without finding more water.
Mr. Nahai said the Department of Water and Power was already studying other possibilities, like using groundwater from within Los Angeles, buying water from other places and desalinating ocean water.
But one thing is certain, he said: ''Are we going to get to a place where we are going to pump all the water out? No.''
Still, most everyone suggests there could be rough going ahead. Ms. Cash, the Inyo County supervisor, said officials were only ''cautiously optimistic'' about a changed relationship with Los Angeles because they had heard nice words from the city before, only to end up in court.
Mr. Nahai acknowledged that the litigious nature of the relationship would be difficult to break.
''Nobody can guarantee there won't be litigation in the future, and litigation has its uses,'' he said. ''There is no denying what the City of Los Angeles has done far too often has been because of court order.''
He added, ''It's like what Mark Twain said: 'Whiskey is for drinking, and water is for fighting over.' ''

With his wife, his children and his parents looking on, Eliot Laurence Spitzer was officially sworn in at midnight as the 54th governor of New York State during a private ceremony here at the governor's mansion.
Standing by a fireplace, Mr. Spitzer placed his hand on a Bible and repeated the oath of office, in a very loud and clear voice: ''I, Eliot Spitzer, do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of New York, and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the governor of the State of New York according to the best of my abilities, so help me God.''
ALBANY, Monday, Jan. 1  With his wife, his children and his parents looking on, Eliot Laurence Spitzer was officially sworn in at midnight as the 54th governor of New York State during a private ceremony here at the governor’s mansion.
With his wife, his children and his parents looking on, Eliot Laurence Spitzer was officially sworn in at midnight as the 54th governor of New York State during a private ceremony here at the governor's mansion.
Standing by a fireplace, Mr. Spitzer placed his hand on a Bible and repeated the oath of office, in a very loud and clear voice: ''I, Eliot Spitzer, do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of New York, and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the governor of the State of New York according to the best of my abilities, so help me God.''
A cheer rose from the guests: ''Go get 'em, Eliot!''
And with those words, New York's Democrats reclaimed the governor's office after 12 years of Republican rule, and Mr. Spitzer, 47, ascended to a historic office that has been held by Franklin and Theodore Roosevelt, Alfred E. Smith, Thomas E. Dewey and Hugh L. Carey, who was present.
A more festive public inauguration ceremony with pomp, circumstance, food and music is scheduled to be held Monday afternoon, but Mr. Spitzer needed to take the oath of office by midnight in order to ensure the smooth transition of government as he took over from Gov. George E. Pataki, whose 12-year term ended at midnight.
Mr. Spitzer was sworn in by Judge Robert W. Sweet, the Federal District Court judge who gave Mr. Spitzer his start in public service, hiring him as a clerk in 1984 after his graduation from Harvard Law School.
With the new governor were his wife, Silda Wall Spitzer; his daughters, Elyssa, 17, Sarabeth, 14, and Jenna, 12; his parents, Bernard and Anne Spitzer; and dozens of political figures and family friends.
The party was not without drama.
Lloyd Constantine -- Mr. Spitzer's friend, tennis partner, onetime law partner and co-chairman of his transition team -- continued his tradition of buying Champagne for a Spitzer oath of office. The bottles seem to grow in size with the job. As Ms. Wall Spitzer put it, ''The bottles just keep getting bigger.''
This time Mr. Constantine went for a 12-liter bottle of Veuve Clicquot called a balthazar. But opening it did not prove easy -- the Champagne did not flow until Mr. Constantine attacked the giant bottle with a wrench, enlisted the help of another guest, and eventually broke the lip of the bottle, cutting his hand, and waving the bloody hand in triumph. Asked if it was worth it, he said, ''Yeah, sure.''
The public festivities later Monday were to feature New York State wines from Long Island, the Hudson Valley and the Finger Lakes, as well as regional specialties like Guss's pickles, Junior's cheesecake and Buffalo wings from the Anchor Bar in Buffalo.
There was some trepidation about the weather forecast, though. Mr. Spitzer, who spoke about the value of optimism during the campaign, planned an outdoor inaugural for New Year's Day in Albany (and a 6 a.m. run through Washington Park). But with light rain falling, and freezing rain forecast, most of the inaugural events were pushed back an hour in the hopes that the bad weather would move through.

As she wrote her first inaugural speech, M. Jodi Rell turned to the remarks of Gerald R. Ford. Like the former president who took over after the resignation of Richard M. Nixon, Governor Rell was looking for a way to soothe nerves, not make waves.
She was sworn in on a hot day in July 2004 after the abrupt resignation of Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican who would be sentenced to a year in federal prison on corruption charges. ''People were so disappointed, they were so disillusioned, they had just lost faith,'' Ms. Rell said, apparently referring to both her own situation and President Ford's. ''They just needed somebody to say it's going to be O.K. and we are going to get past this.''
After two years characterized by initiatives to clean up corruption, M. Jodi Rell now must attack more complex problems, such as soaring health care and energy costs.

''They just needed somebody to say it's going to be O.K. and we are going to get past this.''
Now, with Mr. Ford's death coinciding with Ms. Rell's preparation for her first full term, she said her role as the state's leader had evolved. She was no longer the accidental governor.
''After the election, it just felt like coming back to work. Nothing really changed,'' Ms. Rell, a Republican who swept 63 percent of the vote in November, said in a recent interview at the Capitol here. ''But it's only in the last week or so where it's hit me -- this is different. The expectations and the new session gives you pause to say all right, this is what we are going to do. This is my agenda.''
Extremely popular and perceived as honest and calm, Ms. Rell is just now beginning to form her own cabinet, dismissing nearly all of Mr. Rowland's top assistants.
After two years largely characterized by initiatives to ''right the ship'' in a state crippled by corrupt politicians, Ms. Rell, who will be sworn in on Wednesday, now must attack more complex problems, such as soaring health care and energy costs. And though she was one of only a handful of Republicans in the Northeast who managed to retain a top office this election season, Ms. Rell faces a veto-proof Democratic majority in both chambers of the General Assembly.
The dominance of Democrats could certainly hobble Ms. Rell's plans to cut taxes. Already, she has compromised one of her signature ideas: after legislative leaders indicated they would block her efforts to cut the car tax, Ms. Rell dropped the subject, saying she would choose her battles carefully.
''I think we are approaching a time where we have to come up with some really creative solutions, and if the governor can't get there it is possible the honeymoon would be over,'' said Donald E. Williams Jr., leader of the Democrats in the State Senate.
But for all the chatter in political circles of their party's new power, Mr. Williams and other Democrats speak of the Republican governor in tones usually reserved for one of their own.
''I don't think anyone is looking for unnecessary fights,'' Senator Williams said. ''The governor has sealed her popularity among voters and made people feel extremely comfortable.''
Confrontation and flashy speech are not Ms. Rell's style. Elected to the State House of Representatives in 1984, she earned a reputation for dealing with mundane details, picking apart legislation and knowing precisely where there was room for compromise.
That approach helped lead to a sense of Ms. Rell, 60, as a maternal figure, something that has stuck through her term in executive office. Some Democrats remark privately that when the governor admonishes them to kill or push through a bill, it is like being scolded by their mother.
Ms. Rell cultivates that image: In a season of brutal campaign attack advertisements, one of her commercials featured the governor sitting in a chair with her grandson. A public service announcement encouraging drivers not to drink and drive has Ms. Rell on a playground surrounded by children.
And when she released a health care proposal last week, half a dozen children sat on either side waving to the television cameras. Peering out at the audience over her bifocals, Ms. Rell resembled a teacher reading the lesson of the day.
Ms. Rell and her supporters have always been happy to acknowledge that she was an unlikely candidate to become the state's top political figure. A former homemaker who dropped out of college, Ms. Rell earned her political education on the job, working her way up to become minority leader of the House before being tapped by Mr. Rowland to run for lieutenant governor.
The two were never particularly close, and Ms. Rell maintains that she had no clue about Mr. Rowland's wrongdoings, something that infuriates opponents trying to tie her to the corrupt administration.
Such criticisms have somehow yet to stick. Even when Ms. Rell's chief of staff became embroiled in controversy for distributing invitations to a political fund-raiser on state time last year, voters consistently told pollsters they trusted the Rell administration.
Some people in both parties complain that Governor Rell has done little to articulate or push her own agenda, instead favoring policies typically backed by Democrats such as stem-cell research or civil unions for same-sex couples. Others see that as her strength.
''You hear Democrats claim: 'She hasn't done anything, she hasn't done anything,' '' said Chris Barnes, a pollster at the University of Connecticut. ''Well, the last governor did something and the something was lining his pockets. People are quite happy this governor is not doing that something.''
Instead, Ms. Rell has wisely been ''adjusting the course rather that setting it,'' Mr. Barnes said. ''People were not begging for grandiose plans. They just want the government not to mess things up.''
Such a modest goal aptly sums up the governing philosophy of Ms. Rell, who describes herself a steadfast moderate who believes in ''less government, less intrusive government, and less spending whenever possible.''
Her biggest fights with the Legislature will likely be over the budget, which Ms. Rell will present in February, and taxes.
Also, Democrats plan to making universal health care a top priority, while Ms. Rell last week offered a far more limited proposal than what Democrats envision.
Ms. Rell opened the health care bidding last week with a plan to let uninsured adult residents buy into a pool with a premium of $250 a month. Emphasizing that she would not support a ''big government'' subsidy, Ms. Rell said the cost of the plan to the state would be minimal.
After decades in public office, Ms. Rell can still appear wary of the spotlight, blushing at the slightest embarrassment or standing at the back of a crowd -- and she guards her privacy.
When she had a mastectomy to remove breast cancer two days after Christmas in 2004, her assistants did not announce the operation until she was already at the hospital and asked well-wishers not to send flowers.
There are signs of increasing comfort with the pageantry; on Wednesday, Ms. Rell will lead the first inaugural parade and ball the state has had in more than a decade (though she turned down a society reporter's request to photograph her off-white ball gown last week).
''I think you're going to see more and more of her,'' said Robert Farr, an ally of Ms. Rell who recently retired from the General Assembly. ''A year ago she was the governor by accident, but she can clearly be the real thing now.
''She is not going to be one rushing for press conferences,'' Mr. Farr added. ''She is not one to go out and state a political position every day. But when she stakes something out, she is going to present something that can give measurable results.''
For her part, Ms. Rell said she is still drawing inspiration from the former president she looked to the first time she took the oath of office.
''Gerald Ford was not flashy,'' she said, her voice softening. ''He wanted to talk to people. And I know that's what I want. I want people to feel comfortable. I want them to see a governor up close.''

43 <html><head><b><center>Overall Crime in New York Fell 5 Percent in 2006, but Homicides Increased<center></b></head><p align="left">Murders in New York City rose by 10 percent in 2006 over 2005 to 579, even as overall crime continued to decline; homicides were well below 2,262 in 1990; rise reversed declining trend; overall crime fell 5 percent in 2006 compared to 2005; reported rapes were down 7.4 to 1,486; subway crime plunged 13 percent and auto crime fell 11.4 percent (M)
In New York City, rapes, robberies and assaults, among other crimes, continued to decline last year, prompting the Police Department's top official to herald 2006 as a very good year. Homicides, however, climbed 10 percent in the city, reversing a much-hailed decrease.
''We'd like to see no homicides. The reality is we're going to have them,'' said Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly. ''I think this is a very good year.''

In New York City, rapes, robberies and assaults, among other crimes, continued to decline last year, prompting the Police Department's top official to herald 2006 as a very good year. Homicides, however, climbed 10 percent in the city, reversing a much-hailed decrease.
''We'd like to see no homicides. The reality is we're going to have them,'' said Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly. ''I think this is a very good year.''
He called the increase in killings in 2006 all but negligible compared with 1990, a year with one of the highest homicide rates in recent history. That year, crack-fueled violence soared, and 2,262 people were killed.
Last year there were 579 killings citywide as of Dec. 24, an increase of 52 homicides over the same period in 2005. Yet overall crime last year was down 5 percent. The number of reported rapes declined by 7.4 percent to 1,486, subway crime plunged 13 percent and auto theft fell 11.4 percent.
The police said the year's jump in homicides was rooted largely in an unusually high number of ''reclassified'' deaths, deaths linked to injuries incurred in months or years past. There were 38 reclassified homicides in New York last year, compared with 21 in 2005.
New York's overall fall in crime also contrasts with an increase nationwide. According to a report by the F.B.I., violent crime across the country rose 3.7 percent during the first half of the year. Dallas remained the country's most violent city, with 3,985 crimes per 100,000 people, according to the midyear report, while New York ranked 10th with 1,1,87 per 100,000.
Myriad factors account for New York's continuing decline in crime overall, the police and criminologists say. They cited more effective policing, shifting drug patterns and the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years.
Yet what is puzzling, one expert said, is that overall crime is dropping even as New York becomes an increasingly polarized city, with haves and have-nots often living side by side in luxury condominiums and public housing.
''Within a few blocks, people are living worlds apart,'' said Andrew Karmen, a sociology professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the author of ''New York Murder Mystery: The True Story Behind the Crime Crash of the 1990s.''
''In theory, that should make the poor more dissatisfied and drive people to commit crimes,'' he said. ''But that doesn't seem to be happening in New York.''
One possible explanation, Dr. Karmen said, is that the city is largely populated by immigrants, many of whom are driven by a determination to succeed.
''I think they still maintain a positive outlook and faith in the American dream,'' he said. ''But if it doesn't deliver, attitudes could change.''
It has proven difficult to root out violent crime in the city's toughest corners.
One of the city's most perilous neighborhoods is in the 75th Precinct in Brooklyn, which includes East New York. There the number of slayings last year was virtually unchanged from 2005 at 28, and 3,239 crimes were reported.
Public housing projects have a disproportionate number of crimes. While 5 percent of New York's eight million residents live in public housing, Commissioner Kelly said, 16 percent of the city's homicides take place there.
The Police Department plans to tackle that seemingly intractable problem by redeploying personnel from other areas and opening police substations in the most troubled housing complexes, Commissioner Kelly said.
Both homicide victims and suspects tend to have links to crime already, he said.
Of those arrested last year in homicides, 95 percent had criminal histories; 75 percent of the people killed did.
Such figures point to the department's need to continue expanding its homicide, shooting and crime databases, Mr. Kelly said.
''The more information we have, the greater the potential we have to prevent crimes,'' he said.
New York's rebirth as a safer-than-average large city since the 1990s has coincided with an increase in tourism here.
According to city officials, about 44 million people visited last year on business or pleasure.
''One overarching reason why people are coming here, in a city that was attacked five years ago, it's because they have a sense of comfort as far as security is concerned,'' Mr. Kelly said.
The department is continuing to pour more resources into community policing, forging bonds between its officials and local leaders, especially those from new immigrant communities.
Yet in neighborhoods where homicide rates climbed, residents seem divided about whether this recent and heightened focus was improving their lives.
Allah B, the director of the Allah in Mecca Youth Center in Harlem, commended officers in its precinct, the 28th, for holding local forums and listening to community concerns.
Even though slayings in the precinct more than doubled, to 11, last year, he said the increased connection between residents and the police fostered a greater sense of ease.
Yet a longtime resident of the St. Nicholas Homes in Harlem said police efforts to rout out criminals were having a divisive effect in her neighborhood.
''They caused a lot of trouble trying to play one person against the other,'' said the woman, who would give only her first name, Keisha. She said people in the neighborhood also felt harassed and persecuted by the police, and that such impressions heightened the tension and stress in the community.
Still, despite a slight increase in the number of homicides in her neighborhood, she said the streets felt far less violent than in previous years.
The sense that New Yorkers are increasingly inhabiting two different realities seems particularly strong in places like Fort Greene, Brooklyn, home to a thriving cafe scene and crime-plagued public housing complexes.
Eleven homicides were recorded in the neighborhood last year, compared with none in 2005.
Strolling along a stretch of DeKalb Avenue by Fort Greene Park late last week, Cheryl Pickett, 36, said she had no idea that murders had risen so sharply in the area.
Ms. Pickett, who has lived in Fort Greene for five years, said her perception of the neighborhood had not changed. She still thinks of it as a safe, child-friendly place with charming shops and bars.
''When things happen, it's really surprising,'' Ms. Pickett said. ''This year seems no different than last.''

As fighting began to flare Sunday around Kismayo, in southern Somalia, the final redoubt for the country's diminished Islamic movement, elders within the city demanded that the Islamists go.
Muhammad Arab, a leader of the Ogaden subclan, said 36 elders of various clans and subclans met over the weekend with Islamist leaders and tried to persuade them that resistance against the huge Ethiopian-backed force heading toward them was futile.
Elders within Kismayo, the final redoubt for Somalia’s Islamic movement, demanded that the Islamists leave.
As fighting began to flare Sunday around Kismayo, in southern Somalia, the final redoubt for the country's diminished Islamic movement, elders within the city demanded that the Islamists go.
Muhammad Arab, a leader of the Ogaden subclan, said 36 elders of various clans and subclans met over the weekend with Islamist leaders and tried to persuade them that resistance against the huge Ethiopian-backed force heading toward them was futile.
''We told them that they were going to lose,'' Mr. Arab said, ''and that our city would get destroyed.''
Kismayo, a scenic harbor town along the Indian Ocean that was once part of the East African spice empire, has been spared the fighting so far. But the Islamists, Mr. Arab said, did not care. ''These guys are bent on war,'' he said.
The fighting started around 5 p.m., with the Ethiopian-backed forces unleashing an artillery barrage against Islamist troops dug in near Jilib, a town about 30 miles north of Kismayo.
[Residents of Kismayo told Reuters Monday that Somali Islamists fled overnight from their final stronghold around the southern port of the city. Several thousand Somalia Islamic Courts Council fighters had been making a last stand north of Kismayo port, but residents said they melted away after the advancing Ethiopian force began its shelling of Jilib. Somalia's interim government vowed to pursue them.]
As the shells began to rain down in Jilib, residents said, clan militias in Kismayo turned on the Islamists.
That set off running gun battles across the city, with several people reported killed. It also accelerated the exodus from Kismayo, with thousands of residents hastily gathering a few belongings and joining the stream of people fleeing the fighting in southern Somalia.
It is hard to predict what is going to happen next. Local support for the Islamists in Kismayo is obviously evaporating, just as it did last week in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital, when clan elders decided that the Islamists were a losing cause and pulled their troops and weapons out of the movement.
That led to the city falling much faster than anyone expected into the hands of Somalia's transitional government, which has used Ethiopian troops and airpower to reclaim much of the country. Clan elders are the pillars of Somali society, and many of the Islamist fighters in Mogadishu were clan militiamen lent to the movement.
But the fighters in Kismayo may be different. Kismayo is where the Islamist leadership fled after losing Mogadishu, taking their most steadfast and hard-core fighters.
Ethiopian officials have said that the Somali Islamists are bolstered by several thousand foreign fighters -- from Yemen, Pakistan, Syria, Libya and Eritrea, Ethiopia's bitter enemy, though American intelligence officials have said that the numbers are far fewer, most likely in the hundreds.
Diplomats are still searching for a way to avert disaster. On Sunday, Kenyan officials, with American encouragement, continued to meet in Nairobi with the few remaining moderate leaders of the Islamist movement in an effort to reach a cease-fire. But the talks were slow-going, said an official close to the parties.
In Mogadishu, the transitional prime minister, Ali Mohammed Gedi, seems to relish his newfound authority. Mr. Gedi, a bookish veterinarian whom few Somalis would have recognized before last week's stunning comeback by the transitional government, is holding daily news conferences, meeting with clan elders and surveying bombed-out buildings for future office space. On Sunday, he reassured the populace in confident tones that the era of warlord rule was over.

In the face of an intense artillery barrage by Ethiopian-backed forces and thousands of well-equipped troops heading their way, the Islamists scattered, with some of their militia shedding their uniforms and melting back into the population while others headed south towards a thickly forested area along the Kenya border.
The Islamist forces in Somalia abandoned their final stronghold Monday morning, fleeing the port city of Kismayo much like they had fled Mogadishu, the capital, last week.
In the face of an intense artillery barrage by Ethiopian-backed forces and thousands of well-equipped troops heading their way, the Islamists scattered, with some of their militia shedding their uniforms and melting back into the population while others headed south towards a thickly forested area along the Kenya border.
''I can't tell you how happy people were that they disappeared,'' Adam Ragay, a businessman in Kismayo, said today.
As soon as the Islamists left, looters rushed into the streets and smashed up stores and ran away with TVs and mobile phones. But by mid-afternoon, the brief burst of anarchy was over and transitional government troops had arrived on the outskirts of town.
''I can confirm to you that our forces have captured Kismayo,'' Somalia's transitional prime minister, Ali Mohamed Gedi, told The Associated Press today.
This leaves the transitional government of Somalia now in control of every major town in south-central Somalia, though there are fears the war may not be over and that the Islamists are simply switching to underground guerilla tactics. It took the transitional government, with the help of the Ethiopian military, one of the most powerful in Africa, all of one week to rout the Islamists.
Residents of Kismayo said the remaining Islamists were heading toward Ras Kamboni, a small town on the Kenyan border which western intelligence officers say has been used as a terrorist hide-out before.
Kenya officials have said that they have increased security on the border to keep the Islamists from escaping through Kenya.
As fighting began to flare up on Sunday around Kismayo, elders within the city demanded that the Islamists go.
Muhammad Arab, a leader of the Ogaden subclan, said that 36 elders of various clans and subclans met over the weekend with Islamist leaders and tried to persuade them that resistance against the huge Ethiopian-backed force heading toward them was futile.

''People of Mogadishu do not have to fear,'' he said.
But many still do. A large explosion rocked an apartment building in Mogadishu on Saturday night, killing a woman. Some residents said it was a missile fired at nearby Ethiopian troops and possibly the opening salvo of an anti-Ethiopian insurgency. Later in the day, Ethiopian troops began to recede from Mogadishu's streets to barracks on the outskirts of the city.

Chris Ratuszny went home from Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan on Thursday, 16 days after a brain operation to treat a distended artery deep in his skull that was in danger of bursting and killing him.
Mr. Ratuszny's operation, which involved the experimental use of a laser, was the subject of an article in Science Times on Dec. 19.
The laser technique, developed in the Netherlands, has not been approved in the United States, but was allowed by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use in Mr. Ratuszny's case. The laser lets surgeons operate on arteries in the brain without clamping them shut, a necessary step in conventional surgery, but one that can cause a stroke.
The experimental technique worked. Mr. Ratuszny (ra-TOOSH-nee), 26, emerged intact -- walking, talking, cracking jokes and eager to see his 3-year-old son, Sam, and return to his job as a Lexus mechanic. He was entirely himself, his family said. The operation had begun to relieve the severe headaches and eye pain he had been suffering for two years because of pressure from the bulging artery, known as a giant aneurysm.
''I don't think he could do much better,'' said his surgeon, Dr. David J. Langer, the director of cerebrovascular neurosurgery at St. Luke's-Roosevelt, Beth Israel and Long Island College Hospital, and an assistant professor at Albert Einstein Medical College.
But like many people who have major operations, Mr. Ratuszny had suffered some setbacks. Dr. Langer had predicted that he might have transient speech problems, because the surgery involved the left side of his brain, which controls speech. That prediction came true, but the problems were a bit worse than even Dr. Langer had expected. Tests soon after the operation revealed large blood clots where the aneurysm had been, suggesting that it might have bled during the surgery. Doctors expected the speech difficulties to diminish as the clots dissolved and the pressure on the brain eased.
Mr. Ratuszny began to improve, but another problem developed: a painful, drug-resistant staphylococcus infection that began in his arm, where an intravenous line had been inserted. He needed powerful antibiotics and surgery to drain the infection.
Then, 10 days after the brain surgery -- just when he was supposed to go home -- Mr. Ratuszny's personality and alertness seemed to sag. Dr. Langer ordered scans and X-rays, and was shocked to find that several major arteries in his brain had gone into spasm, pinching down to only about 20 percent of their normal diameter and restricting the blood supply. The problem, called vasospasm, was most likely a reaction to the blood that had leaked into Mr. Ratuszny's brain from the aneurysm, Dr. Langer said. It responded to treatment and gradually subsided.
Dr. Langer said he expected Mr. Ratuszny to make a full recovery and lead a normal life.

The researchers examined 72 children born to women who completed the study when the children were 2 1/2 years old. In tests of locomotor ability, speech and hearing, vocabulary and practical reasoning, the children whose mothers were given fish oil during pregnancy scored slightly higher, but the differences were not statistically significant. However, after controlling for maternal age, birth weight, breast-feeding and other factors, the children of the women who took fish oil were significantly better at hand-eye coordination than those of the women who took the olive oil supplement.
The authors acknowledged that their sample was small, and that they could not exclude the possibility that the result was due to chance. Still, children who received prenatal fish oil did consistently perform better on all measures of development.
''These preliminary data indicate that supplementation with a relatively high-dose fish oil during the last 20 weeks of pregnancy is not only safe,'' the authors concluded, ''but also seems to have potential beneficial effects that need to be explored further.''

52 <html><head><b><center>When Bad Things Come From 'Good' Food<center></b></head><p align="left">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that E coli strain recently found on spinach from California farm is virulent enough that swallowing only 10 organisms could be enough to cause infection; increased number of health alerts and outbreaks related to fruits and vegetables has generated many new guidelines, such as Food and Drug Administration's lettuce safety initiative, but researchers point to variety of causes and methods of contamination and say they are difficult to track and stop; some experts hold that bagged and prewashed produce is fairly new to marketplace and increased consumption of raw produce make outbreaks more widespread than anytime in past; many researchers are working on prevention measures, but few changes have been implemented; drawings (M)
People in the United States have gotten used to the repulsive fact that raw chicken, meat and eggs are often contaminated with dangerous bacteria. Scrub the cutting board, we are warned, don't nibble the cookie dough, don't eat burgers rare. In other words, handle meat like a biohazard -- and then eat it.
But until recently, getting sick from salad was something that most Americans didn't even think about unless they were traveling to a poor country. At home, fruits and vegetables have been regarded as clean and safe for as long as most people can remember.
Despite disease outbreaks, outrage over filth in produce seems to be lacking.

Scrub the cutting board, we are warned, don't nibble the cookie dough, don't eat burgers rare. In other words, handle meat like a biohazard -- and then eat it.
But until recently, getting sick from salad was something that most Americans didn't even think about unless they were traveling to a poor country. At home, fruits and vegetables have been regarded as clean and safe for as long as most people can remember.
Lately, though, produce has caused a disturbing number of disease outbreaks; just since September, bacteria-tainted tomatoes, spinach and lettuce have made hundreds of people sick, and killed three. There have been 20 serious outbreaks in the past decade or so, and many have come from crops grown in California, not from imports. Fruit juices, alfalfa sprouts and almonds have also been involved -- all of them supposedly health foods, like salad, the things we feel most virtuous about eating.
The known outbreaks are just the tip of the iceberg, health officials say; far more illness is never reported. Most people don't call the health department about a few days of gut trouble. The government estimates that over all, food-borne microbes -- not just the ones on produce -- make 76 million people a year sick, put 325,000 in the hospital and kill 5,000.
In a modern country, a rise in disease caused by tainted food seems like a giant step backward in public health. But there hasn't been much public outrage or even disgust at the notion of filth seeping into the food supply.
Among the nastiest bacteria is E. coli 0157:H7, which makes a powerful toxin that can cause severe illness and sometimes even kidney failure. This is the germ found on spinach a few months ago, and more recently on iceberg lettuce served at Taco Bell restaurants. It comes from cow feces and was first identified in 1982. Feeding the animals grain instead of hay seems to promote its growth.
The strain is harmless to cows, but in people it is so dangerous, according to the Food and Drug Administration, that swallowing as few as 10 organisms may be enough to cause an infection. About 73,000 people a year get sick from this type of bacteria, and 61 die, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports.
''It's gotten more attention this fall, but we've seen these outbreaks due to lettuce and other leafy greens for a long time,'' said Dr. Christopher Braden, chief of the outbreak response and surveillance team for enteric diseases at the disease centers. ''We are seeing this on an ongoing basis. That's not an acceptable outcome. We need to find ways to interrupt that contamination.''
Last August, the F.D.A. announced a ''lettuce safety initiative'' in response to recurring E. coli outbreaks. It began with last fall's lettuce harvest and included visits by inspectors to farms and cooling and packing facilities. But the spinach and Taco Bell outbreaks happened anyway.
There are several ways that bacteria can contaminate lettuce. Water is an obvious route, whether from unsanitary irrigation or spraying, or from flooding. Animals can carry bacteria onto farmland, which is apparently how the spinach outbreak occurred -- feral pigs wandered from cow pastures to spinach fields, taking E. coli with them. Sick workers who handle produce can also contaminate it, and so can dust blowing off pastures. One bad batch can spoil others when they are mixed for chopping and bagging.
Scientists think most contamination lies on the surface of crops, but studies have shown that it is possible for bacteria to be taken up through root systems and actually wind up inside the plants, where no amount of washing could get rid of it. In any case, E. coli 0157:H7 tends to be sticky and is difficult or impossible to wash off, even when it's only on the surface of produce.
Over the past 30 years, diseases linked to produce have increased, Dr. Braden said. Increased ability to detect outbreaks may explain part of the increase, but not all of it, he added.
''We're convinced it's real in large part,'' he said. ''We're seeing an increased number of outbreaks, an increased number of cases in outbreaks, and an increase in the number of types of produce involved.''
The reason is not known for sure. But, Dr. Braden said: ''The way produce is farmed and processed has changed. It's become more centralized, and you have these huge processors and distributors that produce tens of thousands of pounds of a particular produce in a particular day. If something goes wrong with that produce you've got a big problem, whereas with small farmers, if there is a problem it's much more limited.''
In addition, he said, bagged and prewashed produce didn't exist 25 years ago, and people today eat more raw vegetables than in the past.
''There's probably more susceptible people eating those things,'' Dr. Braden said. ''We have an aging population, and more people with chronic medical conditions that might make them more susceptible.''
The F.D.A. is responsible for produce safety, while the Agriculture Department oversees meat, poultry and eggs. Some politicians have urged that a single new agency be formed to take charge of all food safety, but even if that is done, it still may not answer basic questions about how to clean up produce.
Dr. David W. K. Acheson, chief medical officer at the center for food safety and applied nutrition at the F.D.A., said the agency was trying to find ways to prevent outbreaks.
But, Dr. Acheson said, it has nowhere near the resources to inspect the hundreds of thousands of facilities that handle fresh produce in the United States. The Agriculture Department has far more inspectors and is required by law to have one in every major meat processing plant.
One question the drug agency is trying to figure out, he said, is how close is too close when it comes to cattle and produce.
''We know that 0157 is a natural contaminant of cow feces,'' Dr. Acheson said. ''Cow feces, if it gets on fresh produce, is not good. Should there be some limitation as to how close cattle should be to a leafy-greens field? Fifty feet, 5 miles, 50 miles? What's the science?''
Fifty feet may be plenty if the cows are downhill and downstream of the farm, he said -- but if it's the other way around, five miles may not be enough.
''What's really going to work?'' Dr. Acheson asked. ''At this point, there are a lot of unknowns.''
Another approach, instead of trying to prevent contamination, is to get rid of it after the fact. Nuts can be heat-treated and juices can be pasteurized. Some experts have recommended irradiating lettuce.
''People in the agency are looking at the impact of that,'' Dr. Acheson said. ''There are two pieces: does it work, and what dose do you need? Then, what's the impact of that dose on the quality of the product? You could irradiate anything and sterilize it, but you may end up with mush. It's not quite that easy.''
Dr. Braden said that so far, scientists had not found any way to prevent outbreaks.
''Not that people aren't working on it hard,'' he said, adding that the food industry itself is under pressure.
''There may be some self-regulation from the industry, the growers themselves,'' he said. ''They have to do something themselves, or else they're going to lose their market.''

The day's coppery last light reflects off the backs of sea bass swimming in fish ponds lined in neat rows on this desert farm.
Fish farming in the desert may at first sound like an anomaly, but in Israel over the last decade a scientific hunch has turned into a bustling business.
Scientists here say they realized they were on to something when they found that brackish water drilled from underground desert aquifers hundreds of feet deep could be used to raise warm-water fish. The geothermal water, less than one-tenth as saline as sea water, free of pollutants and a toasty 98 degrees on average, proved an ideal match.
''It was not simple to convince people that growing fish in the desert makes sense,'' said Samuel Appelbaum, a professor and fish biologist at the Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research at the Sede Boqer campus of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.
''It is important to stop with the reputation that arid land is nonfertile, useless land,'' said Professor Appelbaum, who pioneered the concept of desert aquaculture in Israel in the late 1980s. ''We should consider arid land where subsurface water exists as land that has great opportunities, especially in food production because of the low level of competition on the land itself and because it gives opportunities to its inhabitants.''
The next step in this country, where water is scarce and expensive, was to show farmers that they could later use the water in which the fish are raised to irrigate their crops in a system called double usage. The organic waste produced by the cultured fish makes the water especially useful, because it acts as fertilizer for the crops.
Fields watered by brackish water dot Israel's Negev and Arava Deserts in the south of the country, where they spread out like green blankets against a landscape of sand dunes and rocky outcrops. At Kibbutz Mashabbe Sade in the Negev, the recycled water from the fish ponds is used to irrigate acres of olive and jojoba groves. Elsewhere it is also used for irrigating date palms and alfalfa.
The chain of multiple users for the water is potentially a model that can be copied, especially in arid third world countries where farmers struggle to produce crops, and Israeli scientists have recently been peddling their ideas abroad.
Dry lands cover about 40 percent of the planet, and the people who live on them are often among the poorest in the world. Scientists are working to share the desert aquaculture technology they fine-tuned here with Tanzania, India, Australia and China, among others. (Similar methods of fish farming are also being used in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona.)
''Each farm could run itself, which is important in the developing world,'' said Alon Tal, a leading Israeli environmental activist who recently organized a conference on desertification, with the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and Ben-Gurion University, that brought policy makers and scientists from 30 countries to Israel.
''A whole village could adopt such a system,'' Dr. Tal added.
At the conference, Gregoire de Kalbermatten, deputy secretary general of the antidesertification group at the United Nations, said, ''We need to learn from the resilience of Israel in developing dry lands.''
Israel, long heralded for its agricultural success in the desert through innovative technologies like drip irrigation, has found ways to use low-quality water and what is considered terrible soil to grow produce like sweet cherry tomatoes, peppers, asparagus and melon, marketing much of it abroad to Europe, especially during winter.
''Most development is still driven by the Zionist ethos that the desert was some mistake of God that we have to correct and make the desert bloom,'' said Uriel Safriel, an ecology professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
The history of fish-farming in nondesert areas here, mostly in the Galilee region near the sea, dates back to the late 1920s, before Israel was established as a state. At the time, the country was extremely poor and meat was considered a luxury. But fish was a cheap food source, so fish farms were set up on several kibbutzim in the Galilee.
The early Jewish farmers were mostly Eastern European, and, Professor Safriel said, ''they only knew gefilte fish, so they grew carp.''
Eventually they expanded to other varieties of fish including tilapia, striped bass and mullet, as well as ornamental fish.
The past decade has seen the establishment of about 15 fish farms producing both edible and ornamental fish in the Negev and Arava Deserts.
Fish farming, meanwhile, has become more lucrative worldwide as people seek more fish in their diet for better health, and ocean fisheries increasingly are being depleted.
The practice is not without critics, who say it can harm the environment and the fish. In Israel there was a decision by the government to stop fish farming in the Red Sea near the southern city of Eilat by 2008 because it was deemed damaging to nearby coral reefs.
Some also argue that the industry is not sustainable in the long term because most of the fish that are farmed are carnivorous and must be fed a protein-rich diet of other fish, usually caught in the wild. Another criticism is that large numbers of fish are kept in relatively small areas, leading to a higher risk of disease.
Professor Appelbaum said the controversy surrounding fish farming in ocean areas does not apply to desert aquaculture, which is in an isolated, controlled area, with much less competition for resources.
On Kibbutz Mashabbe Sade, Amit Ziv runs a fish farm, raising about 15,000 fish at a time. Up to 500,000 cubic meters of water from the fish ponds is recycled for irrigation every year.
''It's a matter of better efficiency,'' said Mr. Ziv, who pays about 24 cents a cubic meter for water, a government-subsidized rate. ''In an area where there is lack of water, being able to use it twice over is a huge advantage.'' Mr. Ziv, 39, said there are benefits to raising fish in the desert: the dryness translates to fewer insects and less mold and disease. He also said the warm air makes it easier to keep the pools temperate.
He remembers the stories his parents, who, along with other founders of the kibbutz in 1948, would tell of having to travel long days to get to the fields of the communal farm. They then tilled closer to central Israel, because at the time the local arid ground was thought to be impossible to farm.
''Now,'' he said, pointing toward the desert-grown crops, ''the fields are all here.''
Mr. Ziv and his dog turned back toward the fish ponds stretched out under green plastic hothouse canopies. It was time to prepare for a shipment of hatchlings that was to arrive the next day.

Pets are supposed to be good for you, right? Consider the various sorts of pet therapy, or studies that suggest that a nuzzle from a dog can lower blood pressure or even nudge someone out of a coma. Some surveys have found that people who have pets report fewer doctor visits and better mental health. Even longer survival after heart attacks has been reported.
And dog-walking must provide exercise and all the benefits that come with it. It only stands to reason that pet owners should be healthier than others. Doesn't it?

Well, not in Finland. Leena K. Koivusilta and Ansa Ojanlatva, two researchers at the University of Turku, looked through data collected in a health survey of 21,101 Finns. Among the questions the participants were asked was whether they owned pets.
No matter how the researchers sliced the data, they found that the pet owners looked, if anything, sicker than pet-free people. Pet owners were more likely to suffer from illnesses that included high blood pressure, high cholesterol, ulcers, depression and kidney disease. They smoked more (though drank less) than people who did not own pets.
They were also fatter, particularly the dog owners, the researchers reported in the current issue of the journal PLoS ONE.
That does not mean pets induce disease. At least in Finland, pet owners tended to be poorer, less educated and older, and those factors, rather than pets, probably explain the health disparity.
Nor does it mean that pets aren't good for you. It's just that the benefits may not be medical.

New Year's Eve Brings Wardrobe Malfunction  Three and a half tons of confetti rained down on the revelers in Times Square on Sunday night as New York celebrated the start of another new year, and similar outdoor parties took place around the world. Among those who chose instead to stay indoors were the viewers of the 57th annual ''Red and White Song Contest,'' a New Year's Eve television special in Japan, who were surprised to see naked dancers on the nationally televised broadcast -- or so they thought. A troupe of dancers wearing flesh-colored bodysuits took the stage during a performance by the singer DJ Ozma, above, forcing the national broadcaster NHK to apologize to viewers for what appeared to be nudity, Reuters reported. The dancers looked topless and wore skimpy bikini-style bottoms, causing about 250 viewers to phone in and complain. ''The dancers were wearing bodysuits, but we apologize for any misunderstanding,'' a presenter announced toward the end of the show.
Storm Troopers and Ewoks Invade Pasadena  Yesterday's 118th Rose Parade featured George Lucas, the ''Star Wars'' creator, as the grand marshal. The parade, which preceded the Rose Bowl game between the University of Southern California and Michigan, began with an Air Force B-2 stealth bomber flyover that brought cheers from the hundreds of thousands of spectators lining the streets of Pasadena, Calif., The Associated Press reported. One highlight was the ''Star Wars Spectacular,'' celebrating the 1977 release of the first film in that sci-fi series. Darth Vader led 200 storm troopers, right, down Colorado Boulevard, while Ewoks swung from trees, and waterfalls ran down the side of the planet Naboo. The actress and singer Kristin Chenoweth performed with a troupe of dancers, and the actor James Garner, Jennifer Berry (Miss America 2006) and the basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar also made appearances.
Efforts to Save A London Museum  The Theater Museum in London, Britain's national museum of the performing arts, is scheduled to close to the public on Sunday after almost 20 years at its Russell Street location in Covent Garden. The museum, which is a branch of the Victoria and Albert and houses one of the world's largest collections of documents and artifacts related to theater, dance, opera and other performances, has been unable to secure financing for redevelopment. Though the collection itself is not in danger and will be placed in the Victoria and Albert collections center, the questions of when and where it will again be on display remain open. The impending closing has caused a protest and the creation of a group called Guardians of the Theater Museum, which is using its Web site (theatremuseumguardians.org.uk) to solicit names for an online petition to save the museum.
Kylie Minogue's Comeback Continues, in Britain  The Australian singer Kylie Minogue rang in the new year with her first British show since recovering from breast cancer, Agence France-Presse reported. Ms. Minogue, 38, left, performed for 12,000 fans at Wembley Arena in London on Sunday night, beginning the British leg of her Showgirl Homecoming Tour. The show was her first in Britain since her cancer was diagnosed in May 2005, and she suspended the tour in Australia to undergo surgery, followed by chemotherapy. She resumed performances in her homeland in November and has six additional dates planned at Wembley, followed by six in Manchester. Ms. Minogue, whose hits include ''Can't Get You Out of My Head'' and ''I Believe in You,'' is Australia's biggest pop star, with an estimated 40 million records sold worldwide.
Arias in the Alehouse  What better theme for a group of opera singers than Italian night? The baritones and sopranos of Opera on Tap will perform an Italian theme night at the Parkside Lounge on the Lower East Side tomorrow night at 8. The ensemble, which has been at Freddy's Bar and Backroom in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, for the last year and a half, aims to make opera more accessible by presenting professional singers in casual environments. Members of Opera on Tap will appear for the first time at Galapagos Art Space in Brooklyn this month, with a ''Greatest Hits'' night on Jan. 21 at 8 p.m. The regular monthly gig at Freddy's continues, with a 9 p.m. show on Jan. 11.

Where Are They Now?  It's not terribly difficult to find the latest news about Jennifer Hudson (she's in ''Dreamgirls,'' in case you haven't heard), Clay Aiken (gay? straight? diva?) or several other stars from previous seasons of Fox's hit show ''American Idol,'' but what have R. J. Helton, Julia DeMato, Jasmine Trias and dozens of other former contestants been doing? The Jan. 8 issue of US Weekly will include updates on more than 50 cast members from the first five seasons of the show. The news of who works construction in Nashville and who tends bar in Texas need keep hungry fans appeased for a only couple of weeks: Season 6 starts on Jan. 16. Jay Mohr, who was the host of NBC's ''Last Comic Standing'' for the first three seasons, and the actress Nikki Cox, of NBC's ''Las Vegas,'' were married on Friday night in Los Angeles, People magazine reported. Ms. Cox, 28, above with Mr. Mohr, was previously engaged to the comic Bob Goldthwait, but this is her first marriage. It is the second for Mr. Mohr, who was married to Nicole Chamberlain from 1998 to 2004.
Theater Notes  Yale Repertory Theater will present ''In the Continuum,'' written and performed by Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter, beginning on Jan. 12 at that New Haven theater. The production, which had a critically acclaimed Off Broadway run in the fall of 2005, is on an international tour. The York Theater Company will present ''Blind Lemon Blues,'' a new musical about Blind Lemon Jefferson, the Dallas street musician who went from singing on a street corner to a recording contract with Paramount Records. Mr. Jefferson made more than 80 recordings in the late 1920s. The limited engagement runs from Feb. 15 to 25 only, before the production heads off on a nine-city international tour. Spare Change productions will present ''The Dirty Talk'' by Michael Puzzo from Jan. 11 through Feb. 4 at Center Stage, New York. The production, directed by Padraic Lillis, was originally developed as part of the Labyrinth Theater Company's Barn series, and was first presented in the 2005 New York International Fringe Festival.

''I was a lover, before this war.'' Those are the first words sung on TV on the Radio's ''Return to Cookie Mountain,'' one of the most widely praised albums of 2006. Whatever the line means within the band's cryptic lyrics, it could also apply to the past year's popular music. Thoughts of romance, vice and comfort still dominated the charts and the airwaves. But amid the entertainment, songwriters -- including some aiming for the Top 10 -- were also grappling with a war that wouldn't go away.
Pop's political consciousness rises in every election year, and much as it became clear in November that voters are tired of war, music in 2006 also reflected battle fatigue. Beyond typical wartime attitudes of belligerence, protest and yearning for peace, in 2006 pop moved toward something different: a mood somewhere between resignation and a siege mentality.

Pop's political consciousness rises in every election year, and much as it became clear in November that voters are tired of war, music in 2006 also reflected battle fatigue. Beyond typical wartime attitudes of belligerence, protest and yearning for peace, in 2006 pop moved toward something different: a mood somewhere between resignation and a siege mentality.
Songs that touched on the war in 2006 were suffused with the mournful and resentful knowledge that -- as Neil Young titled the album he made and rush-released in the spring -- we are ''Living With War,'' and will be for some time. Awareness of the war throbs like a chronic headache behind more pleasant distractions.
The cultural response to war in Iraq and the war on terrorism -- one protracted, the other possibly endless -- doesn't have an exact historical parallel. Unlike World War II, the current situation has brought little national unity; unlike the Vietnam era, ours has no appreciable domestic support for America's opponents. Iraq may be turning into a quagmire and civil war like Vietnam, but the current war has not inspired talk of generationwide rebellion (perhaps because there's no draft to pit young against old) or any colorful, psychedelically defiant counterculture. The war songs of the 21st century have been sober and earnest, pragmatic rather than fanciful.
Immediate responses to 9/11 and to the invasion of Iraq arrived along familiar lines. There was anger and saber-rattling at first, particularly in country music; the Dixie Chicks' career was upended in 2003 when Natalie Maines disparaged the president on the eve of the Iraq invasion. There were folky protest songs about weapons and oil profiteering, like ''The Price of Oil'' by Billy Bragg; in a 21st-century touch, there were denunciations of news media complicity from songwriters as varied as Merle Haggard, Nellie McKay and the punk-rock band Anti-Flag.
Rappers, who were already slinging war metaphors for everything from rhyme battles to tales of drug-dealing crime soldiers, soon exploited the multitude of rhymes for Iraq, while some, like Eminem and OutKast, also bluntly attacked the president and the war.
In 2006 songwriters who usually stick to love songs found themselves paying attention to the war as well. ''A new year, a new enemy/Another soldier gone to war,'' John Legend sings in ''Coming Home,'' the song that ends his 2006 album, ''Once Again.'' It's a soldier's letter home, wondering if his girlfriend still cares. ''It seems the wars will never end, but we'll make it home again,'' Mr. Legend croons, more wishful than confident.
John Mayer starts his 2006 album, ''Continuum,'' with ''Waiting on the World to Change,'' a pop-soul ballad defining his generation as one that feels passive because it's helpless: ''If we had the power to bring our neighbors home from war,'' he sings, ''They would never have missed a Christmas/No more ribbons on the door.'' The best he and they can do, he muses, doubtless to the disgust of more activist types, is to wait until ''our generation is gonna rule the population.''
There is more rage in the guitar onslaught of albums like Pearl Jam's politically charged, self-titled 2006 album. Contemplating the death of a soldier in ''World Wide Suicide,'' the song lashes out at a president ''writing checks that others pay,'' but ends up wondering, ''What does it mean when a war has taken over?'' And in ''Army Reserve,'' a wife and child wait: ''She tells herself and everybody else/Father is risking his life for our freedoms.'' The righteousness of old protest songs has been replaced by sorrow and malaise.
After three years of war, bluster has toned down, even in country music. Merle Haggard, a populist who has always been skeptical of the war in Iraq, tersely insists, ''Let's get out of Iraq, get back on the track, and let's rebuild America first,'' on his most recent solo album, ''Chicago Wind.'' In another song on the album, Toby Keith, whose ''Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)'' was one of country's most bellicose war songs in 2002, joins Mr. Haggard for a duet, suggesting a reconsideration.
Like the electorate, all pop can agree on across political lines is sympathy for the troops. Bruce Springsteen's ''We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions'' included an old song, ''Mrs. McGrath,'' about a soldier crippled in battle; the album's expanded edition added an updated version of a blunt Pete Seeger song from 1966, ''Bring 'Em Home.''
On the hawkish side, the country singer Darryl Worley had a 2003 hit, ''Have You Forgotten?,'' that justified the Iraq invasion as a reaction to 9/11. Now, he has a current Top 20 country hit that reiterates his support for the war but concentrates on its human cost, describing a returned soldier's post-traumatic stress in ''I Just Came Back From a War.''
In a song called ''Bullet,'' the rapper Rhymefest portrays a soldier who enlisted as a way to get scholarship money for college and dies ''with a face full of hollowtips.'' Even as cozy a singer as Norah Jones starts her next album, due this month, with ''Thinking About You,'' a song about a lover killed in combat.
There were plenty of other songs directly about the war in 2006. But beyond topicality, the war also seeped into popular music more obliquely. The year's best-selling country album, ''Me and My Gang,'' by Rascal Flatts, includes ''Ellsworth,'' a song about ''Grandma'' and her dead husband, a veteran who left behind ''his medals/A cigar box of letters.'' Gnarls Barkley's ubiquitous hit single, ''Crazy,'' is about self-destructive insanity: ''You really think you're in control? Well, I think you're crazy.''
Thoughts of mortality fill albums like ''The Black Parade,'' by My Chemical Romance, and ''Decemberunderground,'' by A.F.I. War isn't the only factor behind all the foreboding in current popular music, but it's certainly one.
The 2000s are not the late 1960s, culturally or ideologically, but the musical repercussions of the Vietnam War may hint at what comes next. As that war dragged on, the delirious late 1960s gave way to not only the sodden early 1970s of technique-obsessed rock and self-absorbed singer-songwriters, but also to a flowering of socially conscious, musically innovative soul, the music that John Legend and John Mayer now deliberately invoke. It's as if this wartime era has simply skipped the giddy phase -- which didn't, in the end, turn bombers into butterflies -- and gone directly to the brooding. The end of the Vietnam War in 1975 was quickly followed by the rejuvenating energy of punk and hip-hop; there's no telling what disengagement from Iraq might spark.
Music and the other arts, unlike journalism, don't echo the news. They can be counterweights and compensations, the fantasies that work out, rather than the facts that don't. In the weeks before Christmas, I started noticing that nearly every time I wandered into a store or heard holiday music from a radio, John Lennon's ''Happy Xmas (War Is Over)'' -- that chiming, purposefully optimistic song with the somber undercurrent -- was on the playlist. When even Muzak programmers are facing up to life during wartime, pop is no escape.

Correction:  January 3, 2007, Wednesday  A music column yesterday about pop songs on war misstated the title of the song, about a lover killed in combat, that starts the Norah Jones album due out this month. It is ''Wish I Could'' -- not ''Thinking About You,'' which is the title of another song on the album.

New Yorkers don't often meet up with tiles, outside subway stations or the shower. Tiles flourish, after all, at latitudes where palm trees grow and window shutters are needed to minimize abundant sunlight.
Valencia is just that sort of place. Perched on the Costa del Azahar of Spain, the orange blossom coast on the Mediterranean, the city started as a Roman military colony and was later conquered by the Visigoths. The legendary Castilian nobleman El Cid (a k a Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar) fought the Moors in Valencia in the 11th century. The city changed hands again in the 13th century, when the Aragons from the north took over.
Islamic, Christian and modernist influences all come together in this show at the Queen Sofía Spanish Institute in Manhattan.

Valencia is just that sort of place. Perched on the Costa del Azahar of Spain, the orange blossom coast on the Mediterranean, the city started as a Roman military colony and was later conquered by the Visigoths. The legendary Castilian nobleman El Cid (a k a Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar) fought the Moors in Valencia in the 11th century. The city changed hands again in the 13th century, when the Aragons from the north took over.
This pileup of cultural influences can be detected early in ''Tile Design in Valencia: From the Middle Ages Through the Early 20th Century,'' a show at the Queen Sofía Spanish Institute in Manhattan. Organized by Dr. Jaume Coll Conesa, director of the Museo Nacional de Cerámica y Artes Suntuarias González Martí de Valencia, the exhibition features about 110 works drawn from Valencia museums. It moves at a swift clip through nearly eight centuries, demonstrating along the way the effects of Islam, Christianity and modernism on the ceramic tile tradition.
The earliest fragments, from the late 14th and early 15th centuries, grouped under the heading ''Mystic Geometry,'' exhibit the Muslim strain. The Spanish term for a glazed tile, azulejo, comes from the Arabic az-zulayj, ''little stone,'' and the use of math in the azulejos' arrangement and design is fitting, coming from the culture that invented algebra.
The Islamic influence is also evident in the subject matter. Sharia, or Muslim law, discouraged the representation of icons and images of the living, so intricate, often highly stylized abstract patterns were favored in the early tiles. One fragment, ''Olambrilla (insert tile) With Arabic Funerary Epitaph'' from the 1400s, features flowing Arabic text painted in blue against a white background.
Valencia was one of the most active Mediterranean ports in the 15th century, and its tiles were exported to places as far-flung as Egypt, Syria and Turkey. The biggest customer, however, was Italy, including the Vatican. Examples of Italian exports are in short supply here. Instead the exhibition focuses on a local 15th-century trend: the demand for tiles with heraldic crests, used to mark property. In addition to the usual roaring lions and cackling birds are intriguing tiles created for the Furriers Guild, featuring an instrument used for carding, and a tile showcasing the instrument of the Crossbowman's Guild.
Vibrant color arrived in the mid-16th century by way of Italy and the majolica ceramic tradition. By the 17th and 18th centuries Valencian craftsmen were producing elaborate, multitile scenarios featuring local martyrs, like ''Flagellation of St. Vincent Martyr,'' or large-scale compositions, like ''St. Joachim and the Virgin as a Child,'' or ''Holy Family'' from 1787, surrounded by a twisting vegetal border.
The show's largest work, which the catalog calls the most significant example of Valencian tile design in any museum, is a piece known as the Disdier Paving, from the Royal Family's Tile Factory of Valencia, made in 1808, the year Napoleon invaded Spain. It is a late Rococo fantasy of winged horses, charging knights and theatrical and mythical figures like Pan, Flora, Athena and Victory. Genre scenes featuring the culinary side of Valencia also flourished in the 18th and 19th centuries. A wonderful panel of two bewigged figures, ''Serving Turrón and Chocolate,'' from around 1775 (turrón being the local nougat confection) has a duck dropping down from the sky to knock over a cup of chocolate.
The modern period rivaled the 14th and 15th centuries in importance for the tile industry in Valencia, partly because of demand for Spanish tiles in places like Southern California. Several early-20th-century examples reveal the rage for Art Nouveau, with its attenuated floral motifs.
A stylized frieze of flamingos appears in one work, while another, with a ''neo-Arab'' design, brings the Valencian ceramic tradition nearly full circle. Art Deco panels and geometric compositions from the 1930s predict the wild designs found in Latin America a few decades later. A panel with early versions of Mickey Mouse is a nice example of proto-Pop.
The exhibition ends abruptly in the '30s, when Valencia's tile industry fell victim to the Spanish Civil War (1936-39). The catalog, which includes fine reproductions and essays that dryly rehearse the opening and closing of Valencia's many factories, says only that businessmen were reluctant after the war to invest in technological improvements to revive the tile industry.
After all the space devoted to taxes and tariffs imposed by noblemen in earlier centuries, as well as to the arcane laws of tile production quotas, the catalog's omission of Generalissimo Franco, who ruled Spain until 1975, and his possible impact on the tile trade seems anticlimactic.
There is much to enjoy about ''Tile Design in Valencia,'' although it can feel at times like a walk through a tile showroom. A few photographs show works in what was probably their original positions, but over all the exhibition lacks the contextual material that would adequately describe how these fragments and panels looked and functioned in their intended applications.
''Tile Design in Valencia'' also serves nicely as a brief analogue to the history of Western painting, running alongside the rise of the Baroque and Rococo, 19th-century genre painting and modernism, while demonstrating an early example of extreme multiculturalism with its Islamic, Christian and pagan strains. (Interlacing forms in the early tiles even resemble animal-style motifs from Ireland and Saxony, a similarity that perhaps creeps in as a result of the Visigoths.)
The difference between painting and tiles, of course, is functionality. Works here have served as everything from architectural decorations and floor coverings to funereal monuments, property markers and company advertisements. Despite the efforts of New York's craftsmen and designers, these tiles are considerably more artful than what can be found in the subway.
''Tile Design in Valencia: From the Middle Ages Through the Early 20th Century'' continues through Feb. 1 at the Queen Sofía Spanish Institute, 684 Park Avenue, at 68th Street; (212) 628-0420 or spanishinstitute.org.

In a New Year's weekend bracketed by deaths, it turns out that it was sound, not pictures, that made shocking television.
The background noise in a camera-cellphone recording of Saddam Hussein's execution -- jostling and sectarian insults -- belied the Iraqi government's portrait of the hasty hanging as a cool, considered meting of justice.
The accompanying dark and blurry shot of the Iraqi dictator falling though the gallows' trapdoor -- shown in its two-minute entirety on the Internet but not on most television news programs -- was about as distinct as a sonogram. It was an unsettling sight, but not really all that graphic or gruesome.
It was more the idea of watching Mr. Hussein die -- a snuff reality show -- that spooked many viewers. It certainly gave news directors pause. But the first images of the execution, filmed by Iraqi officials and shown within hours on Iraqi and American television, came without the ambient sounds that defined his final moments.
Networks and cable news outlets hesitated briefly about showing the unexpurgated version after it began ricocheting around the Internet on Sunday. But most news programs showed at least some of it. The tape turned out to hold redeeming -- and damning -- news value: it suggested to viewers that the execution that President Bush initially described as ''an important milestone'' in Iraq's advance toward democracy was actually more of a millstone.
Next to the screams and confusion around the gallows in Baghdad, the slow, stately processions in honor of former President Gerald R. Ford seemed almost on mute. As well-wishers lined up to pass before his flag-covered coffin, lying in state in the Capitol rotunda, the only sound came from marine guards' high-gloss shoes squeaking on the polished marble floor.
Small wonder CNN kept going back to snippets of ''Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine, Pt. 1,'' sung at the raw, boisterous tribute to James Brown in Augusta, Ga. Michael Jackson stood onstage like a bereaved relative, and the Rev. Al Sharpton stepped up as mourner in chief, giving instructions to St. Peter. ''You need to open up the gates for the Godfather,'' he thundered. Mr. Brown's music was the unofficial soundtrack of the era when Mr. Ford was in office (Mr. Brown sang ''Say It Loud -- I'm Black and I'm Proud'' at President Richard M. Nixon's inaugural festivities in 1969), so those incongruous segues made poetic sense.
Some of the most startling images of the new year were the ones meant to distract and entertain. As he did last year, a frail Dick Clark, 77, took a seat in ABC's Times Square studio to preside over his signature holiday special, ''Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve.''
Ryan Seacrest, a Dick Clark Mini-Me and the host of ''American Idol,'' actually led the show. But despite a 2004 stroke that left him in a wheelchair and his speech impaired, Mr. Clark, wearing a tuxedo jacket with shiny lapels, made brief cameos. His voice was slurred and his face gaunt and waxy, but he smiled gamely as he introduced Christina Aguilera and called out the countdown to midnight.
Television has little patience with the aging and not much time for stroke victims, so it was both reassuring and painful to see Mr. Clark struggling to still fit into his nickname, ''America's oldest teenager.''
Anyone who thinks that elderly entertainers can gracefully retire and surrender the limelight don't know anything about show business. As usual, the hardest-working man in it said it best.
In an interview he gave in 1989 while in prison for, among other things, a PCP-fueled high-speed car chase, Mr. Brown was asked how he was feeling.
''I'm well rested,'' the singer replied. ''But I miss being tired.''

Very light jets, private planes that seat four to six passengers and are being produced by a handful of manufacturers, are the lowest priced business or private jet, and are capable of using more than 5,000 noncommercial airports.
Proponents say the aircraft will attract new customers to private aviation, and will be the workhorses of the air-taxi business being planned by several competitors. The Eclipse 500 cost $1.52 million in 2006.
The first model was delivered to its co-owners, David Crowe and Jet-Alliance, a shared-jet operator in Westlake Village, Calif. Mr. Crowe and Jet-Alliance will share use of the plane. Eclipse said that it has 37 aircraft in various stages of assembly and has an order backlog of about 2,500.
The Federal Aviation Administration has estimated that as many as 5,000 very light jets will be in operation within 10 years.
TRANSATLANTIC BUSINESS AIRLINE -- A new discount, all-business-class transatlantic airline, L'Avion, plans to begin six-day-a-week service between Liberty International Airport in Newark and Orly in Paris.
The airline will fly the route with a 757-200 aircraft outfitted with 90 business-class seats. L'Avion was taking bookings yesterday on its Web site, www.lavion.com, for flights starting tomorrow.
The company offered round-trip fares of $999 for the first 1,000 customers who booked, but L'Avion said regular roundtrip fares will start at $1,599.
Two all-business-class, low-fare airlines, Eos and MaxJet, began flying the New York-London Stansted routes just over a year ago, and another all-business-class low-fare start-up, Silverjet, plans to begin service between Newark and London Luton later this month.
All of the start-ups offer fares sharply lower than the typical $9,000 walk-up business-class fares on most major transatlantic carriers.

Sydney Charles Wooderson, a British lawyer who held the world record for the mile and whose athletic career was interrupted in its prime by World War II, died Dec. 21 in a nursing home in Wareham, in the south of England. He was 92.
His death was confirmed by Pat Calnan, an official for the Blackheath & Bromley Harriers Athletic Club.
Sydney Charles Wooderson was a British lawyer who held the world record for the mile and whose athletic career was interrupted in its prime by World War II.
Sydney Charles Wooderson, a British lawyer who held the world record for the mile and whose athletic career was interrupted in its prime by World War II, died Dec. 21 in a nursing home in Wareham, in the south of England. He was 92.
His death was confirmed by Pat Calnan, an official for the Blackheath & Bromley Harriers Athletic Club.
Wooderson was one of the most versatile middle-distance runner of the 1930s and '40s, known for a finishing kick as bold as he was shy. His record in the mile, 4 minutes 6.4 seconds, set in 1937, stood for nearly five years. It was broken, then advanced several times by two runners from Sweden.
Wooderson also held world records for 800 meters and 880 yards.
In 1946, at the European Championships in Oslo, the first major postwar international track meet, Wooderson won the 5,000 meters in 14:08.6, what was then the second-fastest time ever. Three days later, with a troublesome Achilles' tendon, two years removed from rheumatic fever and hinting at the effects of wartime privation, Wooderson retired from international competition. He continued to race, however, and in 1948 won the national cross-country title for the Blackheath Harriers; he later served many years as an official for the club.
Wooderson was known as the Mighty Atom, but he resisted, in bearing and temperament, the extravagance of a nickname. He stood 5 feet 6 inches, weighed barely 125 pounds and wore thick glasses. His poor eyesight kept him out of the war, although he served as a fireman during the blitz of London. He eventually went blind.
Harold Abrahams, the sprinter immortalized in the film ''Chariots of Fire,'' once said, ''If someone were to point out Sydney Wooderson to you on the running track and tell you he was the athlete who had run a mile more quickly than any other human being, you just wouldn't believe it.''
His career was also one of opportunities denied. He failed to advance past the first heat in the 1,500 meters at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, having injured his ankle stepping in a rabbit hole while taking a walk. In 1938, he skipped the Empire Games to take his law school exams. There were no Olympics in 1940 or 1944.
Wooderson remained an inspiration to generations of British runners. Sir Roger Bannister, who in 1954 became the first man to run a mile in under four minutes, remembered watching Wooderson race in 1945. ''He was always a gallant fighter, and I admired him as much for his attitude to running as for the feats he achieved,'' Bannister wrote in his autobiography. ''He was a methodical and unassuming athlete who gave up his time and energy to encourage youngsters even if they showed no promise.''
Like all European athletes before commercial trans-Atlantic flight, Wooderson had limited exposure to his American counterparts. But in June 1939, he arrived at Princeton for what was billed as the Mile of the Century, a showdown against the great United States runners Glenn Cunningham, whose world record Wooderson had broken, and Archie San Romani. A year earlier, Cunningham ran 4:04.4 on a fast indoor track at Dartmouth. The International Amateur Athletics Federation would not recognize the time because Cunningham was paced for each quarter-mile by a different sprinter. But his feat was not lost on other milers.
The race on the Princeton cinders proved a disappointment from the start, with slow splits for the first two laps assuring that there would be no record. With a half-lap to go, Wooderson, who had led the entire way, collided with another runner and stumbled. He finished last in the five-man field, the victory going to Chuck Fenske. The British newspapers cried foul and clamored for a rematch. Wooderson said, characteristically, ''It's better forgotten.''
Wooderson ran his fastest mile, 4:04.2, in 1945, finishing second to Arne Andersson, one of the Swedes who had lowered his world record. But his last chance at Olympic glory ended in disappointment. Asked to carry the Olympic torch into Wembley Stadium to open the 1948 London Games, he was told upon arriving that the honor would go to someone else. According to the organizer of the torch relay, the organizing committee wanted ''a handsome final runner to light the Olympic flame'' and that ''even the then-Queen remarked to me, 'Of course we couldn't have had poor little Sydney.' ''
Wooderson was made a Member of the British Empire in 2000.
He is survived by his wife of 56 years, Pamela, a son and a daughter.
Correction:  January 29, 2007, Monday  An obituary on Jan. 2 about Sydney Wooderson, a British runner who once held the world record for the mile, misstated the name of the federation that did not recognize a 1938 record for the 4:04.4 mile set by Glenn Cunningham at Dartmouth. It was the International Amateur Athletic Federation, not Athletics.
The obituary also referred incompletely to the reasons given by the federation for rejecting the record. It did not recognize any indoor records until 1987, and it has never recognized indoor records set on tracks with laps longer than 220 yards; the Dartmouth track was 264 yards a lap. (As the obituary noted, the federation also rejected the record because Cunningham used four different quarter milers to pace him.)

Within days of convening, the new Congress will return to some of the biggest battles of the last decade as House Democrats try to rush through legislation requiring the government to negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries and overturning President Bush's restrictions on embryonic stem cell research.
The Medicare proposal highlights the profound differences between Democrats and Republicans over the future of the nation's health care system, the proper role of government and the role of private markets in securing the best value for the huge sums spent on health care.

Within days of convening, the new Congress will return to some of the biggest battles of the last decade as House Democrats try to rush through legislation requiring the government to negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries and overturning President Bush's restrictions on embryonic stem cell research.
The Medicare proposal highlights the profound differences between Democrats and Republicans over the future of the nation's health care system, the proper role of government and the role of private markets in securing the best value for the huge sums spent on health care.
State officials say they wish Congress would focus on a more immediate problem: money for the Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides coverage for four million low-income children, is running out in more than a dozen states.
Dr. Rhonda M. Medows, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Community Health, said, ''Our program will run out of federal money in March, and all 260,000 children in the program will lose their health care coverage if Congress fails to act.''
In debating the future of the children's health program, which has broad bipartisan support, Congress will take up proposals to cover some of the 46 million people who have no health insurance.
Dr. Mark B. McClellan, former administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said, ''Congress should consider expanding the Children's Health Insurance Program to low-income adults.'' Many Democrats agree. But even modest proposals may collide with Democratic efforts to restore fiscal discipline and to reduce the federal budget deficit.
Congress convenes on Thursday. Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who is in line to be speaker, has said the House will, in its first 100 hours, vote on bills to authorize drug price negotiations under Medicare and to expand federal financing of stem cell research.
Representative Tom Allen, Democrat of Maine, said he was ''giddy'' at the prospect of being able to legislate on health care after toiling for 10 years in the minority. ''People in Maine find it incomprehensible that the Medicare law has a provision that forbids negotiation of lower prices,'' said Mr. Allen, who introduced a bill to give beneficiaries access to drug discounts negotiated by the government in 1998.
By adding a drug benefit to Medicare in 2003, Congress authorized the biggest expansion of the program since its creation in 1965. The drug benefit, unlike most Medicare benefits, is delivered entirely by private insurers subsidized by the government. The insurers negotiate with drug manufacturers to obtain discounts, often in return for promoting the use of particular drugs. The 2003 law prohibits the government from interfering in those negotiations and stipulates that Medicare cannot establish a list of preferred drugs.
Most Democrats want to repeal the ban on price negotiations. Wendell E. Primus, an aide to Ms. Pelosi, said the Democratic proposal would require the secretary of health and human services to negotiate, but would not specify how.
''It will be very simple language,'' Mr. Primus said. ''We do not think that Congress needs to hammer out all the details. There are a lot of smart people in the administration, including the secretary, who can look at how we're buying drugs -- the Medicaid program, the Department of Defense, vaccines, et cetera -- and figure out the best way of negotiating better prices with drug companies.''
Republicans said they welcomed the opportunity to debate the issue. The House Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, said the Democrats' proposal would ''take a wrecking ball to a popular program that has cut drug costs for consumers through competition.'' Such competition, he said, ''has kept prices lower than anyone expected.''
Administration officials suggested that Mr. Bush would veto a bill calling for price negotiations. Democrats could then exploit the issue in the 2008 campaign, as they did in the midterm elections.
Under a bill introduced in 2005 by several House Democrats, Medicare would offer a government-run drug plan, in addition to all the plans offered by private insurance companies, and federal officials would negotiate with drug manufacturers on the prices of drugs covered by the government plan.
But aides to Ms. Pelosi said House Democratic leaders now wanted to go further. Under their proposal, the government would negotiate on behalf of all people in Medicare drug plans, more than 22.5 million people.
House Democrats assume that if the government negotiates lower drug prices, the savings will automatically be passed on to beneficiaries in the form of lower premiums. But they could not immediately say how they would guarantee that result. In the absence of detailed instructions from Congress, lower drug prices could mean lower costs and higher profits for the insurers that operate Medicare drug plans.
Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, said he did not want the power to negotiate. ''I don't believe I can do a better job than an efficient market,'' Mr. Leavitt said in an interview.
Leslie V. Norwalk, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said that under the Democrats' proposal her agency would have to ''hire hundreds of people to negotiate prices for 4,500 different drugs.'' And Ms. Norwalk said the agency would be besieged by lobbyists seeking higher Medicare payments for specific drugs. That, she said, is ''how Washington really works.''
Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is in line to become chairman of the Finance Committee, helped shape the 2003 law. In March, he voted against a proposal to authorize drug price negotiations. But Mr. Baucus, who is up for re-election in 2008, said he had an open mind and would hold hearings on the idea.
Kate Leone, an aide to the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said Senate Democrats had the same legislative priorities as House Democrats, but were not committed to the 100-hour schedule.
Mr. Primus said the new Congress would also ''give the president another chance to veto a stem cell bill,'' like the one he vetoed in July.
In campaign commercials in 2006, Democrats and some Republicans boasted of their support for embryonic stem cell research as a way to find treatments for a wide range of diseases. Advocates of such research say that, despite gains in the elections, they still do not have the votes to override a veto. They are working with Senate allies on a plan to attach the stem cell bill to unrelated legislation that Mr. Bush would feel obliged to sign.
Lawmakers are also likely to wrestle with these issues:
Many Democrats will try to reduce Medicare payments to managed care plans. They contend such plans are overpaid by about 10 percent. Insurers intend to fight back, with support from the Bush administration, Republican lawmakers and beneficiaries who see the plans as a way to obtain extra benefits at an affordable cost.
Congress faces a huge challenge in devising a new formula to pay doctors for treating Medicare patients. Under the current formula, doctors' fees would be cut more than 4 percent a year for the next decade. Lawmakers are determined to avert such cuts, but see no easy way to pay the cost.
Democrats have drafted legislation to speed the approval of safe, low-cost versions of expensive biotechnology drugs, which account for a growing share of spending on pharmaceuticals.
People who pay for health care, including state officials, employers and insurers, support such legislationas a way to slow spending on biotech drugs, which can cost more than $10,000 a year. Biotech companies argue that their products, made from living organisms, are so complex that they cannot be exactly duplicated by generic drug manufacturers. As a result, they say, a ''copy'' would rarely be interchangeable with the original.
The Food and Drug Administration has approved thousands of generic drugs deemed equivalent to traditional brand-name medicines. But the agency is unsure of its legal authority to approve such versions of biotech drugs.

When the same old irksome question popped up recently at one of his final public events here, Gov. Jeb Bush, addressing Spanish-speaking reporters, gave an atypically dramatic answer: ''Yo no tengo futuro,'' or ''I have no future.''
His words set off round-the-world buzz, with The Daily Telegraph of London going so far as to call them ''a recognition by the Bush family that their dynastic reign in American politics is drawing to a close.''
Jeb Bush returns to Miami this week without the title of governor before his name and, he insists, without any plans for his future.
When the same old irksome question popped up recently at one of his final public events here, Gov. Jeb Bush, addressing Spanish-speaking reporters, gave an atypically dramatic answer: ''Yo no tengo futuro,'' or ''I have no future.''
His words set off round-the-world buzz, with The Daily Telegraph of London going so far as to call them ''a recognition by the Bush family that their dynastic reign in American politics is drawing to a close.''
But in fact, the question lives on. Mr. Bush's spokeswoman said last week that he made the comment jokingly, and when asked about it later in an e-mail message, Mr. Bush himself replied, ''I was misunderstood by a reporter.''
He did not elaborate, leaving the world to know only this much: Half his life after he arrived in Miami as a 27-year-old real estate salesman, Governor Bush returns here this week without the title before his name and, he insists, without knowing what his future holds.
''We're in the preface of the new book in my life and I just don't know yet,'' he told reporters last month in Tallahassee, a day after his official portrait, with a Bible and a BlackBerry in the background, was unveiled at the Governor's Mansion. ''I'm going to take some time off, hopefully do a little fishing, golfing, resting, reading, exercising. And I've got to make a living, so I'll figure it out probably in January.''
Florida, too, has some readjusting to do. After eight years in office, Mr. Bush, 53, is leaving as one of the most popular and prominent governors in state history, not least because of his relationship to President Bush (brother) and former President George Bush (son). Succeeding him is Attorney General Charlie Crist, who is Republican like Mr. Bush but otherwise starkly different.
Despite the wishful prodding of admirers, Mr. Bush has adamantly ruled out a presidential campaign of his own next year, saying that he wants only to return to Miami with his wife, Columba, and their cat, Sugar. Yet rumors about his future have burst forth as regularly as exotic species in the Everglades -- among them that he would be the next commissioner of the National Football League, run for Senate or become Senator John McCain's running mate if Mr. McCain won the Republican nomination for president in 2008.
''The presidency is out of the question at this point because of Bush fatigue,'' said Peter Schweizer, a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford who wrote ''The Bushes: A Dynasty'' with his wife, Rochelle. ''But the vice presidential slot is something that's very much in play. He's a successful governor of an important state, he helps shore up relations with the social conservatives and he has the Bush money machine.''
One of Mr. Bush's former chiefs of staff has gone to work for Mr. McCain's exploratory committee, but several other former aides have signed up with Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, another probable Republican contender.
''Jeb is a policy-driven guy,'' Mr. Schweizer said. ''If he can be a vice president that plays some kind of a policy role as Cheney has, as Gore did in the Clinton administration, then Jeb Bush will be interested.''
Many assume that for now -- at least partly at the urging of his wife, described as shy and eager to be out of the public eye -- Mr. Bush will return to the private sector. He reported a net worth of $1.4 million in 2005, down from $2.4 million in 1998.
He was a partner in a major real estate development firm here until his first, unsuccessful run for governor in 1994, but Mr. Schweizer predicted that Mr. Bush might now seek out work involving the bioscience industry or the Latin American economy, both of which ''he seems particularly animated by.''
All indications notwithstanding, ardent admirers like Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, are not giving up on the prospect of Mr. Bush jumping into the presidential race next year, especially if Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York becomes the Democratic candidate.
''He could step in later than anybody else,'' Mr. Norquist said. ''You can run for president with the last name of Bush, even though there is and will be Bush fatigue, in a year that you're likely to be running against someone whose last name is Clinton.''
For the time being, Mr. Bush bought a car, a Chrysler 300C, and rented a $5,500-per-month, 3,949-square-foot condominium in Segovia Tower, a luxury building overlooking a golf course in lush Coral Gables.
''I have no idea what I will be doing next,'' he wrote by e-mail from Boca Chica, Fla., where he was vacationing with his parents. ''My priorities are to hang out with my beloved wife (until she can't take it anymore! :)), work out every day and figure out what I will do next with my life.''
As for the continued speculation, he wrote: ''I am flattered that all sorts of people are interested in what I am going to do and many have offered advice as well. That will all subside soon.''
Small signs suggest, however, that he will have a hard time giving up executive powers. He told reporters that while buying furniture recently, he had to stifle the urge to tell the store owner a better way of doing business -- a trait his adversaries say they will not miss.
''Bush was the type that if you did not agree with him, he really didn't have time for you,'' said State Senator Frederica Wilson, Democrat of Miami. ''He wanted you to rubber stamp every idea he had, and he wouldn't listen to reason.''
While Mr. Bush is internationally famous, Mr. Crist, who will be sworn in as governor on Tuesday, is a stranger to all outside Florida and, but for his native Tampa Bay region, not particularly well known within the state either. While Mr. Bush was ideologically driven, often making enemies in pursuit of ''big, hairy, audacious goals'' and divisive social policies, Mr. Crist seems above all a pleaser, avoiding firm opinions and promising to be ''the people's governor.''
Yet despite Mr. Bush's abrasiveness and the plunging popularity of his brother the president, he has remained well liked -- or at least respected -- to the end, a feat in a state as ethnically and politically divided as Florida. A poll last month by Quinnipiac University found that 57 percent of Floridians feel he did a ''good'' or ''great'' job as governor, compared with only 10 percent who said he had done a ''bad'' job.
Howard Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, said the poll results reflected approval of Mr. Bush's persona more than of his policies. Mr. Simon pointed out that two major education initiatives during the governor's tenure -- a costly effort to lower class size and another to provide universal prekindergarten classes -- were passed by public referendum, over the governor's objections.
''It needs to be said that the personal appeal and likeability of Jeb Bush has led the press and the public to overlook the extremism of many of his policies,'' he said.
Several of Mr. Bush's pet initiatives in fact failed, including a school voucher program that the Florida Supreme Court found unconstitutional.
But Mr. Bush pushed through $19.3 billion in tax cuts, put an unprecedented emphasis on standardized testing in public schools, privatized thousands of government jobs and ended affirmative action in public university admissions. He also persuaded the Scripps Research Institute and other bioscience research groups to open laboratories in Florida, which he says will makethe state economy less dependent on tourism and create more high-paying jobs.
And he has appointed more than a third of the state's judges, assuring that his socially and fiscally conservative beliefs will continue to hold some sway.
While others have emoted about Mr. Bush's departure -- including his father, who wept as he described his second son's ''decency'' and ''honor'' in a speech in Tallahassee last month -- he has characteristically avoided introspection. Asked last month what he would miss most about the Governor's Mansion, he cited its beauty, its staff -- and its towels.
''Fresh towels -- all you want,'' he said. ''Here, although I've been trained to do otherwise, it's just any time I want I can have many towels.''

During her first 100 hours as House speaker, Nancy Pelosi has vowed, she will sweep an aggressive legislative agenda through the newly Democratic-controlled House.
But first comes Pelosi-palooza.
Extended festivities are expected to dominate the occasion of Nancy Pelosi’s ascendance as the Democrats take control of Congress.
During her first 100 hours as House speaker, Nancy Pelosi has vowed, she will sweep an aggressive legislative agenda through the newly Democratic-controlled House.
But first comes Pelosi-palooza.
In a three-day stretch of whirlwind events beginning on Wednesday, Mrs. Pelosi will celebrate her heritage (at the Italian Embassy), her faith (in a Roman Catholic Mass), her education (at Trinity College), her childhood (in Baltimore) and her current home (in a tribute by the singer Tony Bennett, of ''I Left My Heart in San Francisco'' fame).
She will embrace her status as the first female House speaker with a tea for women. She will highlight her pull among Democrats with a $1,000-per-person fund-raising concert. And she will welcome visitors to the halls of Congress in an open-house tour.
In the midst of it all, when the new Congress opens on Thursday, Mrs. Pelosi will be sworn in to her new post and plans to get to work on the House floor right away.
The extended, carefully staged festivities are expected to dominate the occasion of Mrs. Pelosi's ascendance as the Democrats take control of Congress. Although Senate Democrats are also ushering in a new majority this week, their leaders have arranged much more low-key events intended to celebrate their incoming freshmen rather than Harry Reid, the Nevada senator who will be the new majority leader.
Supporters of Mrs. Pelosi said she had every right -- an obligation, even -- to underscore her new role, given the historic nature of her rise to power. Thus the week is planned to project much more than an ordinary handoff of power in Congress. It is intended to leave a firm imprint of the new House leader's style and substance on the national consciousness, reminding voters that Mrs. Pelosi is both the first woman to take the job as well as a Catholic mother of five with Italian, blue-collar roots.
''It is an introduction of her to the country -- and certainly who she is, as an outgrowth of her family, her growing up in Baltimore, where she went to school, and the values and the roots she had in that community,'' said Representative George Miller, Democrat of California and a close Pelosi ally.
In other words, she is not the liberal extremist her detractors have tried to depict (one Republican advertisement during the midterm election cycle warned that ''liberal Democrat Nancy Pelosi'' would embrace illegal immigrants and reward them with welfare, ominously asking, ''How do we stop her?'').
Yet a number of Mrs. Pelosi's supporters said the aim was not simply to define the new House speaker in mainstream political terms. They said she valued style and flourish -- previously embodied in her fashionable clothes and her habit of taking Ghirardelli chocolates to meetings -- and recognized that an inauguration with flair could help capture the national imagination.
At the same time, part of her power is derived from her vast network of wealthy donors, including California celebrities, who appreciate a lavish thank-you.
Representative Anna G. Eshoo, a California Democrat who has been a friend of Mrs. Pelosi for decades, said, ''It will be done elegantly, because she's so tasteful.''
''It will have some feminine touches to it, obviously,'' Ms. Eshoo said. ''But more than anything else, it is just highly celebratory, because there are so many firsts that are interwoven into her ascendancy.''
Some Republicans have privately complained that Mrs. Pelosi is drawing too much attention to herself and failing to recognize that the week is not about her. Yet past House speakers have often been defined by their strong personalities and individual styles, and Democrats, by and large, said they were glad to see Mrs. Pelosi unabashedly seizing the spotlight.
''I think what she's doing is perfectly appropriate, because she is making history,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, who led the Democratic victory in the Senate.
Many of the week's gatherings are ostensibly devoted to others, as well. The first event, a Mass at Trinity University, where Mrs. Pelosi graduated in 1962, is ''in remembrance of the children of Darfur and Katrina,'' according to a schedule released by her office. A tea that afternoon at the Mellon Auditorium will include a tribute to Ann W. Richards, the late governor of Texas (whose young granddaughter will speak, as will Mrs. Pelosi's). A prayer service at St. Peter's Catholic Church on Thursday is in ''honor of U.S. men and women in uniform.''
On Thursday, after her swearing in, Mrs. Pelosi will sponsor a concert at the National Building Museum (the performers Carole King and Wyclef Jean are expected to attend, along with Mr. Bennett). The next day, she plans to open up Congress for a ''people's House reception'' for the public. That afternoon, the departing mayor of Baltimore and governor-elect of Maryland, Martin O'Malley, will dedicate a city street to Mrs. Pelosi.
The Baltimore ceremony had been originally scheduled as the kickoff event on Tuesday, but it was moved in honor of the national day of mourning for former President Gerald R. Ford.

64 <html><head><b><center>100 Years Later, the Food Industry Is Still 'The Jungle'<center></b></head><p align="left">Adam Cohen Editorial Observer article says food safety has been hard-hit by anti-regulatory climate of Bush administration; says new Democratic-controlled Congress should push for larger budgets for food inspections and create single federal agency responsible for food safety (M)
Nothing in ''The Jungle'' sticks with the reader quite like what went into the sausages. There was the rotting ham that could no longer be sold as ham. There were the rat droppings, rat poison and whole poisoned rats. Most chilling, there were the unnamed things ''in comparison with which a poisoned rat was a tidbit.''
Upton Sinclair wrote ''The Jungle'' as a labor exposé. He hoped that the book, which was billed as ''the 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' of wage slavery,'' would lead to improvements for the people to whom he dedicated it, ''the workingmen of America.'' But readers of ''The Jungle'' were less appalled by Sinclair's accounts of horrific working conditions than by what they learned about their food. ''I aimed at the public's heart,'' he famously declared, ''and by accident I hit it in the stomach.''
Upton Sinclair's book awakened a nation not just to the dangers in the food supply, but to the central role government has to play in keeping it safe.

Upton Sinclair wrote ''The Jungle'' as a labor exposé. He hoped that the book, which was billed as ''the 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' of wage slavery,'' would lead to improvements for the people to whom he dedicated it, ''the workingmen of America.'' But readers of ''The Jungle'' were less appalled by Sinclair's accounts of horrific working conditions than by what they learned about their food. ''I aimed at the public's heart,'' he famously declared, ''and by accident I hit it in the stomach.''
''The Jungle,'' and the campaign that Sinclair waged after its publication, led directly to passage of a landmark federal food safety law, which took effect 100 years ago this week. Sinclair awakened a nation not just to the dangers in the food supply, but to the central role government has to play in keeping it safe. But as the poisonings of spinach eaters and Taco Bell customers recently made clear, the battle is far from over -- and in recent years, we have been moving in the wrong direction.
When ''The Jungle'' was published, the public reaction was instantaneous. Outraged readers deluged President Theodore Roosevelt with letters. Roosevelt was ambivalent, but he invited Sinclair to the White House for lunch, and promised to send his labor commissioner and assistant Treasury secretary to Chicago to investigate.
Sinclair settled into a New York City hotel and started a publicity campaign. He wrote articles with titles like ''Campaign Against the Wholesale Poisoners of the Nation's Food,'' and released more stomach-churning details. Armour made its potted hams, he charged, by taking nubs of smoked beef, ''moldy and full of maggots,'' and grinding them with ham trimmings. In a newspaper letter to the editor, he dared J. Ogden Armour, the meatpacking magnate, to sue for libel.
Sinclair suspected Roosevelt's team would do a whitewash. But its report strongly reinforced the allegations of ''The Jungle.'' It included an array of Sinclarian images, like workers using privies without soap or toilet paper and returning ''directly from these places to plunge their unwashed hands into the meat.'' Popular outrage continued to grow, and the momentum for reform became unstoppable.
As a result of Sinclair's crusade, Congress passed the Food and Drug Act, which had been effectively blocked by industry. At the start of 1907, it became a federal crime to sell adulterated food or drugs, and the new law set up a system of federal inspections. Food had to be labeled, and it was illegal to misstate the contents. Future laws would expand on this newly declared government responsibility to ensure the safety of the nation's food supply.
In recent years, the momentum has shifted. Since the Reagan era, conservatives have tried to turn ''government regulation'' into an epithet. Books like ''The Death of Common Sense,'' a 1990's best-seller, have twisted the facts to argue that laws like a New York ordinance requiring restaurants to clean dishes in a way that kills salmonella are somehow an infringement on liberty.
Food safety has been particularly hard-hit by this anti-regulatory climate. Harmful bacteria are rampant in meatpacking plants and in produce fields, but government oversight is eroding. The Bush administration has slashed the number of Food and Drug Administration inspectors, and it has installed a former lobbyist for the cattle industry as the Agriculture Department's chief of staff.
But this is an unusually promising moment for food safety. Wide media attention was given to last fall's spinach contamination, which killed three and injured more than 200 in 26 states, and to the Taco Bell food poisonings, which made dozens of people ill. And Democrats have recaptured Congress, which should hold hearings to get to the bottom of those recent food disasters and to explore what the next ones are likely to be. It should push for larger budgets for food inspections and, as one Democratic-sponsored bill calls for, create a single federal agency with responsibility for food safety.
The powerful meat and produce industries can be counted on to call on their allies in Congress and the White House for help in resisting. That would come as no surprise to Sinclair, who was already complaining loudly in 1906 that Armour & Co. had contributed $50,000 to the Republican Party, and that the meatpackers had hired a prominent government official ''as confidential adviser as to federal inspection problems.''
The answer, Sinclair believed, was always the same: providing the American people with the gritty truth that they needed to protect themselves. ''The source and fountain-head of genuine reform in this matter,'' Sinclair insisted, ''is an enlightened public opinion.''

Representative John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who with more than 50 years' tenure is the senior member of the House, is not so sure about the idea of creating an independent group to enforce ethics rules.
But Gabrielle Giffords, a brand-new House Democrat from Arizona, considers it a no-brainer. Of the longstanding approach in which lawmakers are seated on the ethics committee to police their peers, Representative-elect Giffords said, ''It is like having the fox guard the henhouse.''
Members of the new Democratic majority have their own differing perspectives, corresponding largely to length of service, that could ultimately prove more crucial to their success or failure.
Representative John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who with more than 50 years' tenure is the senior member of the House, is not so sure about the idea of creating an independent group to enforce ethics rules.
But Gabrielle Giffords, a brand-new House Democrat from Arizona, considers it a no-brainer. Of the longstanding approach in which lawmakers are seated on the ethics committee to police their peers, Representative-elect Giffords said, ''It is like having the fox guard the henhouse.''
Those divergent outlooks over how best to fulfill the Democratic promise to clean up the House are just one illustration of a friction that could develop in the new Congress as the party takes control after 12 years in exile. While most attention will be focused on the divide between Republicans and Democrats, members of the new majority have their own differing perspectives, corresponding largely to length of service, that could ultimately prove more crucial to their success or failure.
Of 233 Democrats who will be sworn in on Thursday, 147 -- 63 percent -- have been elected since Republicans won control of the House in 1994, and have never served in the majority. Those whose service predates the 1994 revolution, on the other hand, number only 86, or 37 percent. But it is this core of senior Democrats, Mr. Dingell among them, who will lead 20 of the 21 major committees and so exercise concentrated legislative power.
The differences in tenure tend to manifest themselves geographically as well. The makeup of the senior membership has a more urban flavor, while those more recently elected tend to come from the suburbs and exurbs. These newer members have faced tougher electoral opposition than their older counterparts, who in many cases represent overwhelmingly safe Democratic districts; a majority of new chairmen have traditional liberal roots.
Lawmakers, senior aides and analysts say the institutional gulf is not necessarily problematic and could even prove beneficial if Democratic leaders are able to harness the experience and skill of the chairmen to the enthusiasm and drive for reform exhibited by the newcomers.
But they worry that it could become a distraction if the ''old bulls,'' as they are sometimes called, believe that less seasoned lawmakers are demanding too much too fast or if the newer members see the veterans as representative of Congressional inertia.
''The guys who have been there for a while and built up seniority saw an abuse of the system, so they know firsthand why it has to change,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, who will be chairman of the Democratic caucus. ''The new members ran on an agenda of why it has to be changed.
''If managed correctly, you have the experience and energy to make changes. If not managed correctly, it has the potential to be a fault line.''
Leading House Democrats say the long-tenured members and those sent to Congress in recent elections broadly agree on a desire to move ahead on social programs, ethics, energy, national security and fiscal responsibility. The differences, they say, are subtler. Do issues studied in the previous Congress, for instance, need a full further examination in committee, in deference to the new chairmen? Is there need for a separate commission to scrutinize war contracting, or should this too be the province of the committees?
In any event, it is clear that the lower classmen, particularly the large and celebrated group of 30 freshmen, want to move quickly.
''The new class coming in and some of the other newer members are absolutely committed to delivering on the agenda we talked about during the election,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who will lead the House Democratic campaign effort for 2008. ''Now that we are in power, we want to make sure that we are changing direction in Washington, and that means following through not just on the big print but the fine print, a break with business as usual.''
Representative-elect Ed Perlmutter, Democrat of Colorado, agreed.
''I don't think the chairs are not looking to be aggressive,'' Mr. Perlmutter said, ''but I do see in this freshman class a real desire to make changes and move things along quickly, because I think that was the direction we were given by our voters.''
Senior Democrats say that as the lawmakers who endured minority status for so long, they are the ones most painfully aware of a need for new direction. Their stake in holding on to a majority, they say, means protecting and advancing the careers of new lawmakers, who in many cases were elected with fund-raising and other help from senior Democrats.
''It is not like we are just now meeting for the first time,'' said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, who will be chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and can tick off the names of junior committee members he has worked with, as well as several freshmen he personally supported. ''We all campaigned for these guys.''
Mr. Dingell said an urge to remake the House was hardly anything new.
''This is a normal phenomenon which occurs in this place every two years,'' he said, ''and I have seen no class come in that could be described as different. We all come here just dying to do something. But the smart ones of us know how to get it done by working within the system. I have no fears they are out to burn the place down.''
But Norman Ornstein, a longtime Congressional observer at the American Enterprise Institute, said he saw competing drives among members of the new majority.
''You have a significant number of Democrats who think the major change is that the whip is now in their hands and it is the Republicans taking the lash,'' Mr. Ornstein said. ''A number of others want to keep the spigots running, but just into their own pockets. Those who genuinely want to change the House -- the way it operates, the culture of Washington -- have their work cut out for them.''
The Democrats' leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the incoming speaker, has been in the House since 1987 but has never been chairwoman of a committee, and so in some respects her role may be that of an outsider free to pursue transformation. In one of her first tests, however, some seven weeks ago, many of those headed for chairmanships opposed her push to install Representative John P. Murtha of Pennsylvania as majority leader. Instead, they backed Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, at least partly because they saw him as a check on Mrs. Pelosi's power. Mr. Hoyer went on to win.
Mrs. Pelosi has told allies that while she respects the authority of the new chairmen, she will not allow them to dominate the party agenda or stall legislative initiatives that have broad support. And she has already indicated that she does not intend to send the party's early legislative initiatives back through the committee process, but will instead bring a minimum-wage increase and energy and health bills, among others, straight to the floor.
Democrats senior and junior say they are watching to see whether their ideals merge or collide. But they view party differences as just another factor they will have to take into account as they assume control.
''I think people understand it is a little bit of a bump and we have to deal with it,'' Mr. Frank said.
Michael Arcuri, a moderate Democrat from upstate New York who won a Republican-held seat in November, said the combination of exuberance and experience should prove an advantage for the party.
''If we strike the balance between the two,'' Mr. Arcuri said, ''we are going to accomplish some pretty incredible things.''

67 <html><head><b><center>Dollars In The Sand<center></b></head><p align="left">Orlando Patterson Op-Ed article says Caribbean tourism industry is too often criticized for wrong reasons; says criticisms of economists are more substantial; says on most islands, most of money spent by tourists leaks out of country to pay for tourist supplies, or for repatriation of profits and salaries; says there is little integration with rest of economy, leaving islands dependent on fickle industry; says despite this, islands with highest tourist dependence are all doing better, per capita, than larger islands with more integrated economies (M)
Tourism is a modern global marvel. Every year, according to the World Tourism Organization, some 700 million people leave for foreign lands. They spend more than $575 billion, making tourism the world's leading item of foreign trade.
Fifteen million of those travelers, mainly from North America, head for the Caribbean, which is by far the most tourist dependent region of the world. On smaller islands like St. Lucia, tourism's contribution to the economy exceeds 70 percent, and the annual number of visitors far exceeds the resident population: Antigua's 64,000 residents put out the welcome mat for 231,000 visitors one recent year.
Critics aside, tourism is keeping the Caribbean afloat.
Tourism is a modern global marvel. Every year, according to the World Tourism Organization, some 700 million people leave for foreign lands. They spend more than $575 billion, making tourism the world's leading item of foreign trade.
Fifteen million of those travelers, mainly from North America, head for the Caribbean, which is by far the most tourist dependent region of the world. On smaller islands like St. Lucia, tourism's contribution to the economy exceeds 70 percent, and the annual number of visitors far exceeds the resident population: Antigua's 64,000 residents put out the welcome mat for 231,000 visitors one recent year.
Why do the tourists come? Most analysts cite the three S's: Sun, Sand and Sea. Others add a fourth: Sex. The sex part is gender neutral, as a stroll though Ocho Rios immediately confirms. Wickedly handsome young men with flowing dreadlocks, some dyed blond, provide rent-a-dread services for women of every nationality. For most, it is a four-day fling; for a few, there is the hope that life will imitate art and, like Stella, they'll get their groove back.
What do the islands gain? Tourism generates desperately needed foreign revenue for the government, creates employment (as high as 60 percent of the jobs in the Bahamas), and makes possible a wide range of support services and industries. For many of the smaller islands, it is a godsend, especially in the face of the collapsing traditional banana and sugar industries.
Nonetheless, the literature on Caribbean tourism is surprisingly critical. Foreign anthropologists complain about the ''tourist gaze'' and the distortion of local cultures; local chauvinists declaim that ''tourism is whorism.'' These criticisms are largely puerile. In Jamaica, it's the locals who do the gazing while the tourists are busy baking themselves behind the high walls of all-inclusive hotels. If anything, tourism enhances residents' awareness of indigenous cultures, and it supports large numbers of entertainers. Reggae artists have no problem singing dated versions of Harry Belafonte's ''Day-oh! Day da light an' me wan' go 'ome'' if it allows them to get nasty and ragamuffin the next night in the thriving dance hall music culture.
The criticisms of economists seem more substantial. The two buzzwords are linkages and leakages. On most islands, most of the money spent by tourists leaks right back out of the country to pay for supplies for the tourists, or for the repatriation of profits and salaries. Thus there is little linkage, or integration, with the rest of the economy, leaving the islands solely dependent on a fickle industry. Leakage runs as high as 80 percent on the smaller islands.
Here is the critics' problem: The islands with the highest leakage and tourist dependence are all doing better, per capita, than the larger islands with more integrated economies. The Bahamas and Antigua have almost no unemployment and per-capita incomes three times that of Jamaica. And these islands have substantially higher human development indexes, the gold standard of how well a country is meeting a broad range of basic needs. Barbados's index of .864 approaches European levels.
The main cost of tourism is its effects on the environment. The disposal of solid waste from cruise ships and the poor treatment of hotel sewage threaten marine fauna, and degrade coral reefs and fishing grounds. Water sports are a menace. Beaches are eroded and landscape violated by bad architectural planning. Noise pollution is often unbearable. Corrective efforts have had limited success.
However, the industry is too often criticized for the wrong reasons. In Jamaica, tourism is booming, and 2007 promises to be the industry's best year. Most American tourists go to the all-inclusives, which are criticized for greedily gating them off from the rest of the local economy. The real situation is more complex, as explained by Dr. Noel Lyon, a Harvard-trained economist and entrepreneur experienced in both farming and tourism.
Jamaica has terrible crime rates, but that has little effect on tourism because travelers know they are safe inside the all-inclusives. Furthermore, the all-inclusives draw substantially on local suppliers. Over all, Jamaica, with a high ratio of local ownership and management, has relatively lower leakage. All-inclusives are actually a nimble adaptation to a volatile social environment. Jamaica's socioeconomic failures cannot be linked to tourism, without which it would be in even more dire straits.

While it's true that the United States Navy still dominates the world ocean -- its total tonnage equals the combined tonnage of the next 17 smaller navies -- American commercial shipping is but a puny remnant of its former self.

IN October President Bush signed the Safe Port Act, authorizing an investment of $6.7 billion to tighten security at American ports. This is a vitally important and overdue step. But it ignores another major problem in maritime commerce: the phenomenal decline of American shipping.
While it's true that the United States Navy still dominates the world ocean -- its total tonnage equals the combined tonnage of the next 17 smaller navies -- American commercial shipping is but a puny remnant of its former self.
In 1948, more than a third of the world's merchant fleet flew the stars and stripes; today that figure is down to 2 percent. Half a century ago, America built more ships than any other nation, and New York City could boast that it was the world's busiest seaport. Sliding from the top since the 1980s, New York now barely ranks among the top 20.
The only American port now on the top-10 list is Los Angeles-Long Beach, an indication of how much maritime trade has shifted from the North Atlantic to the North Pacific.
A major factor in the decline of American shipping has been an antiquated law that prevents American coastal shippers from buying ships made in other countries. By amending this law and, at the same time, encouraging the development of domestic coastal shipping, Congress could help restore America's status as a great and proud maritime nation.
The slump in American shipping is especially surprising when you consider that it was American entrepreneurs who, in the mid-20th century, revolutionized oceanic transport by creating both the standard-size steel shipping container and the supership capable of transporting 50 times as much cargo as a World War II-era merchant ship could.
Shipping has always been the most economically efficient way to carry goods from place to place; it requires no investment in highways or rails, and thanks to the relatively frictionless ease with which ships move across water, fuel costs per ton are low. The arrival of containerized shipping pushed transport costs even lower, swelling world trade and expanding global wealth.
The export-driven economies of Pacific Asia built much of their enormous success upon the new maritime technologies. The United States did not. The Merchant Marine Acts of the 1920s and '30s are one reason why.
Intended to protect the domestic shipbuilding industry, the acts decreed that the only ships allowed to call on two or more consecutive American ports would be those built in the United States, owned by American companies, flying the American flag and operated by American crews.
At the time, the United States still had a large merchant marine. But the acts' restrictions handicapped coastal shipping within American waters, opening the way for the growth of the trucking and freight-rail industries.
To revive the maritime trade, Congress should give shipping companies as much choice in buying ships as their land-based rivals have when buying trucks and train cars.
Freed from the restraints of the Merchant Marine Acts, commercial shippers could not only begin to resume their position in global trade but also handle much more of the freight that moves within our borders. Before railroads and highways were developed, a network of water transportation routes connected America's port cities and towns. Today coastal shipping handles only 2 percent of domestic freight, even though coastal counties hold more than half of the nation's population.
The trucks that carry nearly a third of our cargo clog the highways. That is one reason why Americans now lose at least 3.7 billion hours and 2.3 billion gallons of fuel each year sitting in traffic. Ships could take on a larger share of this freight -- and even some of the passengers now traveling by highway and rail -- and carry it at lower cost.
Congress could further encourage domestic shipping by improving port facilities, just as it maintains interstate highways. And it could invest in developing ship propulsion technologies -- to increase still further maritime savings in fuel costs and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Americans are rightfully concerned about security, but part of protecting the nation is generating a strong economy. Revitalized coastal shipping could shorten our morning commutes as it begins to rejuvenate America's wider maritime economy.

TWO weeks ago, President Bush called for a long-term plan to increase the size of the armed forces. As our leaders consider various options for carrying out Mr. Bush's vision, one issue likely to generate fierce debate is ''don't ask, don't tell,'' the policy that bars openly gay service members from the military. Indeed, leaders in the new Congress are planning to re-introduce a bill to repeal the policy next year.
As was the case in 1993 -- the last time the American people thoroughly debated the question of whether openly gay men and lesbians should serve in the military -- the issue will give rise to passionate feelings on both sides. The debate must be conducted with sensitivity, but it must also consider the evidence that has emerged over the last 14 years.
I now believe that if gay men and lesbians served openly in the United States military, they would not undermine the efficacy of the armed forces.

Indeed, leaders in the new Congress are planning to re-introduce a bill to repeal the policy next year.
As was the case in 1993 -- the last time the American people thoroughly debated the question of whether openly gay men and lesbians should serve in the military -- the issue will give rise to passionate feelings on both sides. The debate must be conducted with sensitivity, but it must also consider the evidence that has emerged over the last 14 years.
When I was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I supported the current policy because I believed that implementing a change in the rules at that time would have been too burdensome for our troops and commanders. I still believe that to have been true. The concern among many in the military was that given the longstanding view that homosexuality was incompatible with service, letting people who were openly gay serve would lower morale, harm recruitment and undermine unit cohesion.
In the early 1990s, large numbers of military personnel were opposed to letting openly gay men and lesbians serve. President Bill Clinton, who promised to lift the ban during his campaign, was overwhelmed by the strength of the opposition, which threatened to overturn any executive action he might take. The compromise that came to be known as ''don't ask, don't tell'' was thus a useful speed bump that allowed temperatures to cool for a period of time while the culture continued to evolve.
The question before us now is whether enough time has gone by to give this policy serious reconsideration. Much evidence suggests that it has.
Last year I held a number of meetings with gay soldiers and marines, including some with combat experience in Iraq, and an openly gay senior sailor who was serving effectively as a member of a nuclear submarine crew. These conversations showed me just how much the military has changed, and that gays and lesbians can be accepted by their peers.
This perception is supported by a new Zogby poll of more than 500 service members returning from Afghanistan and Iraq, three quarters of whom said they were comfortable interacting with gay people. And 24 foreign nations, including Israel, Britain and other allies in the fight against terrorism, let gays serve openly, with none reporting morale or recruitment problems.
I now believe that if gay men and lesbians served openly in the United States military, they would not undermine the efficacy of the armed forces. Our military has been stretched thin by our deployments in the Middle East, and we must welcome the service of any American who is willing and able to do the job.
But if America is ready for a military policy of nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation, the timing of the change should be carefully considered. As the 110th Congress opens for business, some of its most urgent priorities, like developing a more effective strategy in Iraq, share widespread support that spans political affiliations. Addressing such issues could help heal the divisions that cleave our country. Fighting early in this Congress to lift the ban on openly gay service members is not likely to add to that healing, and it risks alienating people whose support is needed to get this country on the right track.
By taking a measured, prudent approach to change, political and military leaders can focus on solving the nation's most pressing problems while remaining genuinely open to the eventual and inevitable lifting of the ban. When that day comes, gay men and lesbians will no longer have to conceal who they are, and the military will no longer need to sacrifice those whose service it cannot afford to lose.

Police investigators sifted through what they said were few clues on Monday in the fatal shooting of a 52-year-old woman and her 30-year-old son, who were found on Saturday night in a basement apartment where they lived with the son's wife and two young children.
The mother, Amelia Garcia, is thought to have died at the scene, while her son, Ferneliz Cruz, died about 24 hours later, on Sunday night, at Stony Brook University Hospital, according to the police. Both were discovered by Mr. Cruz's wife, identified by investigators as Yesenia Hernandez, when she returned from a coin laundry with her two children, an 8-year-old boy, Yerneli, and a 2-month-old.
CORAM, N.Y., Jan. 1  Police investigators sifted through what they said were few clues on Monday in the fatal shooting of a 52-year-old woman and her 30-year-old son, who were found on Saturday night in a basement apartment where they lived with the son’s wife and two young children.
Police investigators sifted through what they said were few clues on Monday in the fatal shooting of a 52-year-old woman and her 30-year-old son, who were found on Saturday night in a basement apartment where they lived with the son's wife and two young children.
The mother, Amelia Garcia, is thought to have died at the scene, while her son, Ferneliz Cruz, died about 24 hours later, on Sunday night, at Stony Brook University Hospital, according to the police. Both were discovered by Mr. Cruz's wife, identified by investigators as Yesenia Hernandez, when she returned from a coin laundry with her two children, an 8-year-old boy, Yerneli, and a 2-month-old.
''The 8-year-old came to our door jumping up and down screaming, 'My grandma and my daddy's dead,' '' said Darlene Kennedy, 32, who lives next door with her six children. ''I went with him to the bottom of the steps of their apartment. His mother was yelling in Spanish. I tried to pull her away from there.''
Detective Sgt. Edward Fandry of the Suffolk County police homicide squad said that Mr. Cruz and his wife had spent the early evening at a local self-service laundry with their two children.
Mr. Cruz returned home with several loads of washed and folded clothing while his wife waited for a final load to dry. She and the children arrived at the basement apartment about 20 minutes after he did, at 8:20 p.m., to find Mr. Cruz and Ms. Garcia lying in pools of blood. Ms. Garcia's body was in the kitchen; Mr. Cruz was found in an adjoining room.
Both had been shot more than once, but the police would not say how many times, or what type of firearm was used. There was no sign of forced entry or robbery.
''We still do not have a clear understanding of what happened,'' Sergeant Fandry said. ''There is no motive, nothing going on that gives us anything yet.''
The family came from the Dominican Republic about 12 years ago, according to neighbors and the police. Ms. Garcia helped raise her son's children. Mr. Cruz worked at a local bakery, and may have held a second job as a waiter.
The police said there was no record of domestic violence in the family, or any history of problems with anyone in the family's large circle of relatives and friends.
Coram, about 50 miles east of Manhattan, is a community of working-class and poor people. Speculators are known to rent out many houses to parolees, including sex offenders, a practice that stirred bitter local protests here last year.
On Monday, some of the victims' relatives and friends helped Ms. Hernandez retrieve some of the family's belongings from the apartment. They carried away bags of shoes and clothing, cardboard boxes, and dozens of cleanly pressed white shirts on hangers.
Mrs. Kennedy, the next-door neighbor, watched from her door.
''When the police came, I took Yerneli to my house,'' she said. ''He stayed with us until relatives came for him. My kids tried playing a board game with him to keep him occupied -- Monsters, Inc. But he kept wanting to go outside.''

A 26-year-old man was fatally shot yesterday afternoon with a single bullet to the back as he walked on a Brooklyn street with his girlfriend, in the first homicide of the year in New York City, the police said.
The authorities said that three people -- all male -- approached the couple about 12:30 p.m. near Tapscott Street and Sutter Avenue in Brownsville, and that one of them fired at the victim, Jonathan Ridley, of Grafton Street. Mr. Ridley was pronounced dead at the scene, and the police said there might have been an angry exchange of words before the gunman pulled the trigger.
The man was shot in the back as he walked with his girlfriend, the police said.
A 26-year-old man was fatally shot yesterday afternoon with a single bullet to the back as he walked on a Brooklyn street with his girlfriend, in the first homicide of the year in New York City, the police said.
The authorities said that three people -- all male -- approached the couple about 12:30 p.m. near Tapscott Street and Sutter Avenue in Brownsville, and that one of them fired at the victim, Jonathan Ridley, of Grafton Street. Mr. Ridley was pronounced dead at the scene, and the police said there might have been an angry exchange of words before the gunman pulled the trigger.
The gunman and the two people with him ran away before two 911 calls -- one from Mr. Ridley's companion -- were made as Mr. Ridley lay dying on a rain-soaked sidewalk in front of 49 Sutter Street. The authorities said it appeared that the victim knew his killer and that the shooting may have stemmed from a dispute over drugs.
Mr. Ridley would have been 27 on the 27th of this month.
The killing was a contrast to the last two New Year's Days in the city. According to police figures, there were six shootings and four homicides on Jan. 1 of last year, and nine shootings and four homicides on the same day in 2005.
In the Brownsville shooting, several area residents said they had known the victim over the years.
''He didn't have a bad rep in the neighborhood at all,'' said Jonathan Samual, 17, noting that he had been a friend of Mr. Ridley's since childhood.
The police said last night that Mr. Ridley had a long record of arrests over the years on charges that included at least one felony. Information on the disposition of the cases was unavailable. They said that he might have been grazed by another bullet in the shooting. Some neighbors speculated that the slaying was related to a large brawl involving a few dozen people that broke out an hour or two after midnight yesterday near the crime scene.
But a man who would provide only his first name, Donny, for fear of retribution from the gunman, said that he was with Mr. Ridley at a New Year's Eve party on Sunday night in another part of Brooklyn.
Donny, who recalled that his friend had some kind of ''off-the-books job,'' said that the victim had been living with his mother and that his father was dead.
Yesterday's homicide follows a year in which there were 579 killings citywide as of Dec. 24 -- an increase of 52 homicides over the same period in 2005.

After Somalia's Islamist forces abandoned their final outpost on Monday, the transitional government moved aggressively to assert control, setting a three-day deadline for all weapons to be turned in and calling for international peacekeeping troops to be sent immediately.
Somalia was already a place where military-grade weaponry was casually flaunted on its streets, but the Islamists' swift collapse has created such a surplus of guns that the average price of a Kalashnikov assault rifle, one of the world's most popular killing machines, has dropped to $15.
After Somalia’s Islamist forces abandoned their final outpost, the country’s transitional government moved aggressively to assert control.
After Somalia's Islamist forces abandoned their final outpost on Monday, the transitional government moved aggressively to assert control, setting a three-day deadline for all weapons to be turned in and calling for international peacekeeping troops to be sent immediately.
Somalia was already a place where military-grade weaponry was casually flaunted on its streets, but the Islamists' swift collapse has created such a surplus of guns that the average price of a Kalashnikov assault rifle, one of the world's most popular killing machines, has dropped to $15.
Ali Mohammed Gedi, the former veterinarian who is the transitional prime minister, said at his daily news conference that he would not tolerate the situation and gave instructions for turning in the weapons.
''Individuals or groups of people who have trucks mounted with antiaircraft guns, known as 'technicals,' should bring those battlewagons to Mogadishu's old port,'' he said.
Clan leaders were skeptical about whether he would succeed, and many Somalis seemed dead set against it. ''They're trying to neuter us,'' said Muhammad Duudo, an unemployed car mechanic. ''And it's not going to happen. Just wait until the full moon passes and the darkness comes.''
Whatever lies ahead, encouraging or ominous, most Somalis seemed to agree that after a week of fast-moving events, the rough outlines of a new reality were emerging. For the first time since the former dictator, Mohamed Siad Barre, fled the country in 1991, casting Somalia into 15 years of anarchy, there is a credible government based in Mogadishu, the capital, with serious outside support and no organized military threat from within.
True, countless gunmen still roam the streets, heavily armed warlords still command authority and the seeds of a possible guerrilla movement may be taking root.
But so far no major force has emerged to challenge the authority of the transitional government. The only rival, the Islamists, lost their last conventional military battle on Monday. The Islamists had steadily lost ground since Dec. 24, when Ethiopia unleashed a punishing series of airstrikes and pushed ground troops deep into Somali territory.
Ethiopian officials justified their intervention in Somalia's messy, violent internal politics by saying the Islamist movement was a regional threat with terrorist connections and ambitions to invade their country. Ethiopia commands one of the most powerful militaries in Africa, and within days of its entrance into the war, Burhakaba, a pivotal inland town, fell from Islamist control -- then Jowhar, another key town, and then Mogadishu, the Islamists' former stronghold.
By Sunday, the last remnants of the Islamist forces, which just a few weeks ago controlled a large swath of Somalia, were cornered in Kismayo, a port city on the south Somali coast. Thousands of Ethiopian and transitional government troops were closing in on them, and on Sunday night, the Ethiopians began pounding away with heavy artillery.
At the same time, Kismayo clan elders were pleading with the Islamists to leave. The elders said the Islamists did not stand a chance, and they were worried that their city was about to be flattened. Clan elders in Mogadishu similarly decided last week that the Islamists were a losing cause and pulled their troops and weapons out of the movement.
As in Mogadishu, the Islamists in Kismayo, after many fiery speeches about fighting to the death, simply fled. By Monday morning, many of the Islamists' fighters in Kismayo had shed their uniforms and melted back into the population while others headed south toward a thickly forested area along the Kenyan border.
''I can't tell you how happy people were that they disappeared,'' said Adam Ragay, a businessman in Kismayo.
As soon as the Islamists left, looters rushed into the streets and smashed up stores and ran away with televisions and cellphones. But by midafternoon, the brief burst of anarchy was over and transitional government troops had arrived on the outskirts of town.
Residents of Kismayo said the remaining Islamists were heading toward Ras Kamboni, a small town in an isolated area on the Kenyan border that the Islamists had used before as a hide-out. Ethiopian intelligence officials say operatives of Al Qaeda, invited by the Islamists, planned the 1998 attacks on American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania from Ras Kamboni.
Kenyan officials say they have increased border security to keep the Islamists from escaping. ''Anyone who ventures to enter Kenya will have to go through a very serious vetting process,'' Alfred N. Mutua, a Kenyan spokesman, said in a statement on Monday.
Mr. Gedi has acknowledged that he needs a lot of outside help. Security in Mogadishu is still uncertain, with just a light presence of soldiers.
Mogadishu's ports and airport remain closed, strangling the flow of goods and sending prices for rice, sugar, oil and gasoline through the roof. The schools remain closed.
One of the Islamists' first steps after beginning their ill-fated attack on the transitional government was to close all schools to funnel more teenagers to the front. Their move backfired both militarily and politically after countless teenage soldiers were summarily mowed down by better-trained Ethiopian troops.
Abdi Sallah, a pharmacist in Mogadishu, said he thought that the new government was heading in the right direction but that it needed to step gingerly. ''So, we ask all the militia to turn in their weapons and then what happens?'' he said. ''Do they become part of a national army or do they become unemployed? Have these guys thought all this through?''

The United States and its allies in Europe, in a tacit acknowledgment that sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council in late December are too weak to force Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions, have embarked on a new strategy to increase the financial and psychological pressure.
The plan is to use the language of the resolution to help persuade foreign governments and financial institutions to cut ties with Iranian businesses, individuals in its nuclear and missile programs and, by extension, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, said Stuart Levey, under secretary of the treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence.
The U.S. and Europe want to use a U.N. resolution on Iran’s nuclear plans to persuade governments and banks to cut ties with the country.
The United States and its allies in Europe, in a tacit acknowledgment that sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council in late December are too weak to force Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions, have embarked on a new strategy to increase the financial and psychological pressure.
The plan is to use the language of the resolution to help persuade foreign governments and financial institutions to cut ties with Iranian businesses, individuals in its nuclear and missile programs and, by extension, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, said Stuart Levey, under secretary of the treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence.
The Guard and its military wing are identified as a power base for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
Under his administration, American officials said, the Guard has moved increasingly into commercial operations, earning profits and extending its influence in Iran in areas involving big government contracts -- including building airports and other infrastructure, oil production and the providing of cellphones.
Bush administration officials, who asked not to be identified because they were discussing diplomatic plans, said envoys would soon head abroad to press officials of foreign governments and banks to interpret the Security Council resolution equally aggressively.
The new strategy builds on the Treasury Department's efforts over the past few months to get Western banks to scale back business with Iran or risk running afoul of American laws. In 2006, the European banks Credit Suisse First Boston and UBS said they would not do any new business with Iran.
It is hard to assess how deeply the financial actions may cut, since the most willing parties to the effort -- the United States and Europe -- have few business dealings with Iran. The United States does have laws that give it considerable leeway to impose financial restrictions on banks and companies doing business in Iran, while European law does not.
That said, Britain is also backing the new push, as is France, although to a lesser extent. Germany, with far more business interests in Iran, is not quite as eager. Japan is not a member of the Security Council, and the country is heavily dependent on the Persian Gulf for oil. But Japanese government officials have recently indicated their willingness to limit some of their business dealings with Iran.
Last month, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation announced that it would not issue any new loans for Iranian projects until Iran resolved the nuclear impasse with the West. In addition, Japan has reduced its stake in an initial $2 billion deal to develop Iran's largest onshore oil field at Azadegan to 10 percent from the originally agreed 75 percent, citing concern about Iran's nuclear program.
While United States officials have discussed what they are trying to do with their Russian and Chinese counterparts, the belief is that they have gone about as far as they are willing to go with the Security Council resolution that passed Dec. 23. Russia fought to keep certain entities off the list and to keep the list as narrow as possible.
Mr. Levey noted that the resolution cited three people as off limits to outside commercial transactions, and, in another section, prohibited transactions with agencies ''owned or controlled'' by them. The three, he said, are Maj. Gen. Yahya Rahim Safavi, commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps; Gen. Hosein Salimi, who is in charge of the air force branch of the corps; and Ahmad Vahid Dastjerdi, who runs the Aerospace Industries Organization.
Thus, an effort to bar future foreign commercial or government involvement, including bank transactions, affecting missile programs and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard is authorized by the resolution, Mr. Levey said.
''This resolution will be a big step forward in getting governments and financial institutions to pay more attention to Iran's use of deceptive financial practices to facilitate its dangerous conduct and to stop doing business with the I.R.G.C.,'' Mr. Levey said, referring to the Revolutionary Guard.
The resolution says that ''all states'' will ''take the necessary measures'' to bar ''financial assistance'' and ''financial resources or services'' related to nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The resolution's appendix cites several government and private groups and 12 people as involved in those programs; interrupting foreign involvement with those groups and individuals is also part of the new campaign.
But American officials have no figures on the value of international business done with those cited in the resolution.
The United States and European officials said they had also begun trying maneuvers aimed at undermining the self-assurance of Iranian officials, especially those who travel abroad.
The recent arrests of four Iranian diplomats by American troops in Iraq, the officials said, played into that strategy. Pentagon officials said the Iranians were suspected of transferring improvised explosive devices from Iran to Iraq. Iran complained loudly that the men were diplomats and that their arrest violated accepted diplomatic rules. The diplomats, two of whom American officials said were probably members of the Revolutionary Guard, were eventually released.
But their arrests are ''precisely the type of thing that will chip away at their confidence,'' one European official said. Most of the Western officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the issue.
Even before the new effort began, the slowdown in international business was already emerging as a problem for Iran, which has vast oil fields but relatively little refining capacity. It imports 43 percent of its gasoline, according to the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, a Washington-based nonprofit group that follows energy issues.
In a rare acknowledgment of difficulty, the Iranian oil minister, Kazem Vaziri-Hamaneh, told the ministry's news agency, Shana, recently that Iran was encountering obstacles in financing oil projects. ''Currently, overseas banks and financiers have decreased their cooperation,'' Mr. Vaziri-Hamaneh told the agency.
Iran is already seeking to secure gasoline imports from its allies, including Venezuela, and shifting some dependency from gasoline to natural gas.
''Definitely, the Iranian economy is suffering a great deal as a result of the economic punishment,'' said Gal Luft, the executive director of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security. But he added that Mr. Ahmadinejad ''is not just sitting on his hands and waiting.''
The new strategy comes in part because few believe that the sanctions resolution that passed Dec. 23 has the muscle to sway Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions, which it insists are focused on energy production, not weapons. The road to sanctions was a tortuous one, filled with wrangling between the United States, which pushed for tough measures, and Russia, which advocated weaker measures.
United States and European officials said they might still try to include tougher sanctions through the United Nations in the months ahead. But they say the West will need to use other measures as well.
Specifically, the United States will press France, Germany, Italy and other European countries to halt credits that encourage doing business in Iran. The German Ministry of Economics, in a credit program called Hermes, says on a Web site that Iran is among ''risky markets, which are also growth markets,'' identified for such credits.

''Why are you even here?'' Ms. Raskin asked the man, Robert Ephrata, a fundamentalist preacher, as they stood amid the chaos of the Strip, where many revelers were nursing open containers of alcohol, some wearing clothing so skimpy Britney Spears might blush.
Mr. Ephrata, a fixture of New Year's Eve on the Strip for the past four years, smiled. He knew he was an odd sight. He and about 30 loosely affiliated itinerant preachers bank on their incongruity when they show up each year here and, the next morning, at the Rose Bowl Parade in Pasadena, Calif., to recite Scripture and issue warnings of an approaching apocalypse.
''I am here because I love you enough to warn you that if you do not alter your wicked ways, you will go to hell and I don't want you to go to hell,'' Mr. Ephrata responded in a soothing voice. ''I am here because I love you.'' And because the crowds here and in Pasadena combine for the year's biggest audience for his message.
''Where else can you preach to a combined 3.1 million people in such a short period of time?'' asked Mr. Ephrata, 55, who said he was raised Roman Catholic near Puget Sound and lived a wild life of drugs and sex in the 1960s. He cites a motorcycle accident in his mid-20s as ''quite literally my Damascus road moment,'' in which he turned more intensely to faith.
Single, Mr. Ephrata lives in a modest home he owns in Bellingham, Wash., where he leads the Fairhaven Believers Fellowship, a small fundamentalist congregation. Modeling himself after the Apostle Paul, who sold tents to finance his traveling ministry, Mr. Ephrata earns money as a contract carpenter and spends it traveling to dozens of events a year, like Mardi Gras in New Orleans and Mormon conventions in Salt Lake City. Last year he took his message to Africa.
He and the other preachers left Las Vegas at 1 a.m. Monday and drove 250 miles west, arriving at 8 a.m. to walk the Rose Bowl Parade route. Although not officially sanctioned by parade organizers, groups of fundamentalist preachers have been attending the parade for decades, Mr. Ephrata said. Later they stood outside the Rose Bowl.
The flavor of the events here and in Pasadena could not be more different, he said. The Strip is overwhelmed by hedonistic masses committing a litany of sins, he said, who can be dangerously belligerent as they get more drunk. The Rose Bowl Parade offers a family-friendly atmosphere where few spectators are confrontational.
Mr. Ephrata stood on the Strip with his 3-by-5-foot placard reading ''Got Jesus? It's Hell Without Him'' late Sunday night, amid a stream of expletives aimed at him and the three other preachers nearby. The group left an hour earlier than planned because people were hitting them, he said, and throwing ice and drinks.
Bryan York of Dallas was glad to see them go. ''They make me so mad, the nerve of them,'' said Mr. York, who is gay and made a point of kissing his boyfriend in front of Mr. Ephrata. ''How dare they judge other people?''
Mr. Ephrata said he had altered his tactics for this trip to the Strip. In years past, he was on his bullhorn insisting that people were damned and that the Southeast Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina were examples of God's anger. This year, he said, he found that answering people calmly and telling them that he worried about them was more likely to yield a productive conversation.
It did not always work. One intoxicated woman whose breasts were almost completely exposed harangued him until he could not restrain himself.
''Go home and put some clothes on,'' Mr. Ephrata told her angrily. ''You're causing me to sin by looking at your breasts. You are dressed that way on purpose. Go and sin no more, woman. Go and sin no more.''

And there was evening, and there was morning: the first day.
Sorry, sorry. It's just that it is hard not to get biblical when talking about our new governor, Eliot Spitzer.
And there was evening, and there was morning: the first day.
Sorry, sorry. It's just that it is hard not to get biblical when talking about our new governor, Eliot Spitzer.
For so long, he has been treated by New York's political and chattering classes as if he were Savior, Messiah and Mahdi, rolled into one. Inadvertently, a touch of Genesis slipped in after listening to him announce yesterday, in his characteristic returned-from-Sinai cadences, that ''Day 1 of our time for change has arrived.''
Looking to the future, the brand-new governor said in his inaugural address: ''The people seek change. Let us give them sweeping and fundamental change that is certain and immediate.''
Oops. Sorry again. Got my notes mixed up. Mr. Spitzer didn't say those last two sentences. His message was the same. But the actual words came from Gov. George E. Pataki's first inaugural speech, 12 years ago.
Mr. Spitzer also said yesterday that the November election was not about him but about New Yorkers' collective desire for the future. ''The outcome,'' he said, ''was not so much a personal vindication as it was the judgment of the people of New York'' on the policies and principles that underpinned his candidacy.
Oh boy. Sorry once more. Those were indeed Mr. Spitzer's sentiments. But the language belonged to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo at his first inauguration, in 1983.
As you can see, everything may change on Day 1 -- except perhaps for an obligatory pledge from the new person in charge that henceforth all will be different.
Who knows? Maybe ethically and metabolically challenged Albany is indeed headed for a metamorphosis. But Mr. Spitzer may do well to remember Mr. Cuomo's admonition years ago that while politicians ''campaign in poetry,'' they must then ''govern in prose.''
Not that there has been much poetry coming from Mr. Spitzer (or, for that matter, from any other major New York politician of recent vintage). His phrases lean more toward the lawyerly than the lofty, although he sought yesterday to evoke memories of one of the great inaugural addresses, that of President John F. Kennedy in 1961.
What New York needs, the governor said, is ''a politics that asks not what is in it for me, but always what is in it for us.''
That channeling of Kennedy served, no doubt unintentionally, as a counterpoint to an echo of Richard M. Nixon emanating, also unintentionally, from Joseph L. Bruno, the State Senate majority leader. Mr. Bruno's business dealings are being investigated by the F.B.I. ''I am guilty of nothing,'' he said as 2006 wound down. That may be true. It was difficult, nonetheless, not to think of Nixon's ''I'm not a crook'' line.
Whatever its outcome, the Bruno inquiry reinforces the degree to which Albany, as Mr. Spitzer suggested yesterday, has been on snooze alarm for much of the last decade. That is certainly the case when it comes to ethical behavior.
With at least a dozen elected officials having been investigated, arrested, indicted or jailed in the last few years, the state capital is almost as crime-ridden as Dodge City on a Saturday night. The situation is such that the inauguration ceremony yesterday might well have been covered live by Court TV, perhaps with Bernard B. Kerik providing the color commentary.
Into this mess steps a new governor whose well-publicized investigations as attorney general led some to call him ''the sheriff of Wall Street.'' It is a cliché favored by the same types who insist on referring to Rudolph W. Giuliani as ''America's mayor.''
The two men share certain traits. Both are highly intelligent and determined to succeed. Both also seem to believe in their intellectual and moral superiority, and have shown a capacity for vindictiveness. ''The world's smartest man'' was Representative Charles B. Rangel's description of Mr. Spitzer. It wasn't said admiringly.
As with Mr. Giuliani, the veneration of Mr. Spitzer has its skeptics. Those who see the new governor as having at least one foot of clay already note his appointed secretary of state, a lobbyist for Cablevision with roots in the Bronx Democratic machine. Maybe not everything changes on Day 1, after all.
Fortunately for Mr. Spitzer, he has time to work whatever miracles he has in mind. Yesterday, there was evening, and today there is morning: the second day. Way back when, that was the day the waters parted above and below the firmament.

George E. Pataki, who became a private citizen yesterday, will be assigned a 24-hour security detail, a privilege rarely offered to a former governor.
A spokesman for Mr. Pataki, David Catalfamo, said that Mr. Pataki's staff had asked the state police, which provides security to governors while they are in office, to evaluate whether Mr. Pataki would need security after leaving office.
George E. Pataki, who became a private citizen yesterday, will be assigned a 24-hour security detail, a privilege rarely offered to a former governor.
A spokesman for Mr. Pataki, David Catalfamo, said that Mr. Pataki's staff had asked the state police, which provides security to governors while they are in office, to evaluate whether Mr. Pataki would need security after leaving office.
''We asked whether or not it would be necessary going forward, and they said it would be,'' Mr. Catalfamo said. He said it would cost the state about $20,000 a week, and possibly more, depending on the number of state police officers assigned to the job. Mr. Catalfamo would not comment specifically on the level of security that would be provided.
Gov. Eliot Spitzer also approved the arrangement, said Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for Mr. Spitzer.
''They'll take the steps to make sure that he has sufficient security,'' she said.
Mr. Catalfamo noted that Mr. Pataki was the first governor to leave office since the Sept. 11 attack. ''I think there's a greater awareness and sensitivity of the security of New York governors and elected officials in a post-9/11 government,'' he said.
He added that the arrangement would most likely be temporary, and would be re-evaluated by state police officials each month. He also said the state police would probably seek additional advice on the matter from outside law enforcement agencies, like the United States Secret Service.
News of Mr. Pataki's security detail was reported yesterday by The New York Post.
Mr. Catalfamo said the security arrangement was also approved by the State Ethics Commission, which last year sharply criticized State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi for his use of state employees as chauffeurs and aides to his wife, who he claimed needed security. Mr. Hevesi was re-elected in November, but agreed last month to resign and plead guilty to one felony charge.
Mr. Pataki's detail will be limited to him alone, and will not include coverage for members of his family.
Neither Mr. Catalfamo nor Ms. Anderson was certain whether any past governor was granted a security detail after leaving office, and a spokesman for the state police was not available for comment yesterday.
But the last two New York City mayors, David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani, enjoyed a similar privilege. The Police Department provided each with a temporary security detail after he left office, according to a department spokesman.

Hundreds of people emerged from tents beside this city's Canal St.-Martin to greet the chilly New Year with a hot lunch from a nearby soup kitchen. But not all of them were homeless.
Dozens of otherwise well-housed, middle-class French have been spending nights in tents along the canal, in the 10th Arrondissement, in solidarity with the country's growing number of ''sans domicile fixe,'' or ''without fixed address,'' the French euphemism for people living on the street. The bleak yet determinedly cheerful sleep-in is meant to embarrass the French government into doing something about the problem.
France’s homeless problem is relatively mild  roughly 86,000 are homeless on any given night  but even that number is too high for the socially active in France.
Hundreds of people emerged from tents beside this city's Canal St.-Martin to greet the chilly New Year with a hot lunch from a nearby soup kitchen. But not all of them were homeless.
Dozens of otherwise well-housed, middle-class French have been spending nights in tents along the canal, in the 10th Arrondissement, in solidarity with the country's growing number of ''sans domicile fixe,'' or ''without fixed address,'' the French euphemism for people living on the street. The bleak yet determinedly cheerful sleep-in is meant to embarrass the French government into doing something about the problem.
''Each person should have the minimum dignity in a country as rich as this,'' said Bleunwenn Manrot, a 28-year-old with a newsboy cap on her head and a toothbrush in her hand. Ms. Manrot drove more than six hours with friends from her home in Carhaix, Brittany, to spend New Year's Eve along the canal.
The demonstration has drawn enough media attention over the holidays for President Jacques Chirac to acknowledge it during his traditional New Year address to the nation on Sunday. He asked the government to work in the coming weeks to ''put in place a truly enforceable right to housing'' that would give the homeless the legal means to demand a place to live.
Given France's well-financed social services, the country's homeless problem is relatively mild -- the national statistics bureau estimated the number of people living without a fixed address on any one night at 86,000 for all of France in 2004, about equal to the number of homeless in Los Angeles alone.
But even that number is disturbing for the socially active segment of France's population. In December 2005, the French affiliate of the international charity Doctors of the World began distributing nylon pup tents to people who sleep on Paris's sidewalks and beneath its bridges. The movement took hold, and since then the tents have become a fixture in odd corners of the city.
In an effort to increase pressure on politicians, another group, Don Quixote's Children, marshaled some of the tent dwellers last year to set up their tents along the Canal St.-Martin, in the heart of ''bobo'' (short for bourgeois bohemian) Paris. The canal was dug by Napoleon to supply Paris with clean drinking water. Since mid-December, the encampment has become a happening in one of Paris's most happening neighborhoods.
''There are 250 tents now,'' said Jean-Baptiste Legrand, the organization's president. ''The people keep coming, and the tents are full.''
The protest has started to spread to other cities, including Orléans, Toulouse and Lyon, and has been picked up by politicians as the presidential campaign gets under way.
François Hollande, the leader of the Socialist Party, and Bertrand Delanoë, the mayor of Paris, have signed the group's petition calling for a solution to the housing problem. Both of the leading presidential candidates -- Nicolas Sarkozy, of the governing Union for a Popular Movement, and Ségolène Royal of the Socialists -- support the cause.
Catherine Vautrin, the minister for social cohesion, met with Mr. Legrand and other members of his group and last week announced a tenfold increase in spending to help the homeless, to $92 million from $9 million. She said the money would allow homeless shelters to stay open around the clock on weekends and extend their weekday opening by three hours a day.
But a legally enforceable right to housing is the biggest prize sought by housing activists, including Don Quixote's Children, and they remain skeptical of Mr. Chirac's New Year promise. France already has a hard time housing new immigrants and asylum seekers. Fires in overcrowded, substandard lodgings have caused scandals in recent years. Finding a place for the hardcore homeless is certain to complicate those problems.
''Chirac's speech means nothing,'' said Ms. Manrot, the Brittany protester.
Such comments suggest that the long camp-out will continue. Organizers have arranged portable toilets and a soup kitchen to keep the ad hoc village operating. Vans of blankets and other supplies arrive regularly, much of the material donated by Parisians. Volunteers sweep the canal-side cobblestones to keep the area clean.
''I like the protest because it's nonviolent,'' said another protester, Renaud Huvé, 39, a photographer. ''It's a citizens' call.''
So far, the authorities have been tolerant, though they have quietly evicted tent dwellers before, when the news media were not watching. The police broke up one encampment under a bridge farther north along the canal in October.
Magali Marx, 23, a sales assistant in a clothes shop, expressed the laissez-faire attitude of the neighborhood's residents as she passed by. ''It's a bit of a pain for the people who want to walk along the side of the canal,'' she said. ''But then, these people don't have a roof.''
Not all of the homeless are down-and-out French. A group of immigrants continues to live farther up the canal beneath what people in the area have dubbed ''the bridge of the Afghans.'' The government says that a third of the country's homeless hold jobs.
The homeless who make up the bulk of the canal-side campers are thankful for the attention. ''Let's hope it makes a difference,'' said Jean, a middle-aged man who said he had been living on the streets of Paris for eight years.
But staying on the street is anything but restful for those who have a warm bed waiting at home. Rain and high winds dampened the canal-side New Year's Eve celebration. Ms. Manrot and her boyfriend, Franck Renardineau, ended up sleeping in their car.
''I sleep in one of the tents,'' Mr. Legrand said, rubbing his pale, exhausted face. ''But I've stayed at home a couple of times. We've got a lot going on.''

Romania and Bulgaria joined the European Union on Monday, helping to end geographic divisions left over from the cold war and extending the borders of the now 27-member bloc eastward to the Black Sea.
In Bucharest, Romania, President Traian Basescu said Sunday night that the entry into the European Union signaled the end of a painful 17-year process. ''We arrived in Europe, welcome to Europe,'' he said to rapturous applause from a crowd in University Square. ''This is an enormous chance for new generations.''
Their accession, the second wave of enlargement into Eastern Europe, gives the E.U. a stable political and economic anchor in an unstable region.
Romania and Bulgaria joined the European Union on Monday, helping to end geographic divisions left over from the cold war and extending the borders of the now 27-member bloc eastward to the Black Sea.
In Bucharest, Romania, President Traian Basescu said Sunday night that the entry into the European Union signaled the end of a painful 17-year process. ''We arrived in Europe, welcome to Europe,'' he said to rapturous applause from a crowd in University Square. ''This is an enormous chance for new generations.''
In Sofia, the Bulgarian capital, revelers gathered in Battenberg Square. Fireworks filled the sky over the building where the Communist Party once had its headquarters. ''We are home!'' said a headline in the Bulgarian newspaper Trud.
Romania and Bulgaria, now the European Union's poorest members, hope that membership will help them raise their per capita wealth, which is one-third of the Union average. Their accession, the second wave of enlargement into formerly Communist Eastern Europe, will also give the Union a stable political and economic anchor in an unstable region.
Romania, with a population of about 22 million, becomes the European Union's seventh largest member. Bulgaria has a population of 7.7 million.
For Romania, which suffered one of Eastern Europe's most brutal Communist dictatorships under Nicolae Ceausescu before he was overthrown in 1989, being moored to the European Union is an important symbolic final break with a difficult past. For Bulgaria, whose history is marked by conflicts with the Ottoman Empire and Soviet occupation, European membership is also viewed as a source of economic and democratic stability.
The European Union has been experiencing expansion fatigue, though, after the bloc's enlargement in May 2004 to 25 countries from 15. With the latest additions, the Union has a population of nearly 489 million.
Some members, like France, are concerned that the addition of member nations with much lower per capita incomes, the European Union will become economically overburdened, institutionally unwieldy and ultimately unmanageable. They fear that expansion will diminish their power while paralyzing the European Union's decision-making process.
Wariness about the future shape of the Union was reflected in French and Dutch rejections of a proposed European constitution in referendums in 2005. Since then, there have been calls across the bloc for a slowing of the pace of enlargement.
Such ambivalence, stoked by fears of immigration and Europe's lackluster economic performance, has been most prominently expressed in opposition to admitting Turkey, which is Muslim. It has also cast a shadow over the admission of Romania and Bulgaria, which have been criticized for corruption that has lingered since Communist times.
Some countries, though, led by Britain, with the enthusiastic backing of the United States, have supported further expansion because the promise of membership has helped accelerate economic and political change in Europe, ranging from the arrest of war criminals in Croatia to the liberalization of Turkey's banking industry.
The cautious approach to further expansion was reflected in the tough conditions imposed on Romania and Bulgaria for entry.
Even now that they are in the Union, the two countries will be subject to unprecedented safeguards devised to keep them from backtracking. They include the power by the European Commission, the union's executive, to suspend some of the rights that come with membership, like generous economic aid.
The commission has also threatened to suspend recognition of arrest warrants and decisions made by Bulgarian courts if the country does not improve its judicial system.
Romania expects to receive as much as $ 2.2 billion in the first year after entry, while Bulgaria would be entitled to $873 million.
The European Union has been grappling with fears that westward migration from its poorer members in the east risks undermining the bloc's social standards.
At the time of the last enlargement, in May 2004, the European Commission estimated that the number of migrants throughout the bloc would total 70,000 to 150,000 a year. But Britain alone is estimated to have received up to 600,000 in the past three years.
Britain, Sweden and Ireland, which opened their doors to European Union newcomers in 2004, have already signaled that they are less inclined to do so now. Romanians and Bulgarians may also face obstacles in labor markets in Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, which are themselves confronting restrictions by countries further west.
At a recent meeting in Brussels, European leaders toughened their tone on enlargement but stopped short of setting new hurdles to expansion. They reaffirmed backing for the eventual membership of Turkey, Albania, Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia.

With thousands of Iraqis desperately fleeing this country every day, advocates for refugees, and even some American officials, say there is an urgent need to allow more Iraqi refugees into the United States.
Until recently the Bush administration had planned to resettle just 500 Iraqis this year, a mere fraction of the tens of thousands of Iraqis who are now believed to be fleeing their country each month. State Department officials say they are open to admitting larger numbers, but are limited by a cumbersome and poorly financed United Nations referral system.
Thousands flee Iraq every day, but the U.S. has placed strict limits on the number of Iraqi refugees allowed to settle in America.

Until recently the Bush administration had planned to resettle just 500 Iraqis this year, a mere fraction of the tens of thousands of Iraqis who are now believed to be fleeing their country each month. State Department officials say they are open to admitting larger numbers, but are limited by a cumbersome and poorly financed United Nations referral system.
''We're not even meeting our basic obligation to the Iraqis who've been imperiled because they worked for the U.S. government,'' said Kirk W. Johnson, who worked for the United States Agency for International Development in Falluja in 2005. ''We could not have functioned without their hard work, and it's shameful that we've nothing to offer them in their bleakest hour.''
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat who is taking over the immigration, border security and refugee subcommittee, plans hearings this month on America's responsibility to help vulnerable Iraqis. An estimated 1.8 million Iraqis are living outside Iraq. The pace of the exodus has quickened significantly in the past nine months.
Some critics say the Bush administration has been reluctant to create a significant refugee program because to do so would be tantamount to conceding failure in Iraq. They say a major change in policy could happen only as part of a broader White House shift on Iraq.
''I don't know of anyone inside the administration who sees this as a priority area,'' said Lavinia Limón, president of the United States Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, a nongovernmental refugee resettlement agency based in Washington. ''If you think you're winning, you think they're going to go back soon.''
For Iraqis, a tie to the United States is a life-threatening liability, particularly in harder-line Sunni neighborhoods. In 2003, Laith, an Army interpreter who would allow only his first name to be used, got a note threatening his family if he did not quit his job. His neighborhood, Adhamiya, was full of Baath Party loyalists. A month later, his father opened the door to a stranger, who shot him dead.
Laith's mother begged him to stop working, but his salary, $700 a month at the time, supported the entire family. Then someone threw a sound grenade at the house. Graffiti appeared on a wall in ugly black paint accusing Laith of selling information about insurgents to the military. Laith and his family moved out of the house. Soon after, it was broken into and photographs of him with American soldiers were found in a family photo album.
''They know me,'' he said, sitting in one of Baghdad's hotels, because his family would not allow a Western reporter inside the house. ''They know when I come and go.''
Many Iraqis who worked for Americans have already fled the capital or the country, and many plead for help or asylum on a daily basis. Of some 40 nationalities seeking asylum in European countries in the first half of 2006, Iraqis ranked first with more than 8,100 applications, according to the United Nations.
Remarkably few apply for refugee status in the United States, mainly because most Iraqis, even those who have worked for the United States government here, simply assume that getting American status is all but impossible. Iraqis cannot apply directly for refugee status in the American Embassy in Baghdad.
Another interpreter, Amar, who did not want his full name used, went to at least 10 embassies during a trip to Jordan last fall, but found only blank faces. He counts his sacrifice for America in bones and skin. He is missing a finger, an eye and part of his skull, after a large bomb exploded next to his Humvee last year. He has received two threats to his life. Two bodyguards accompany him everywhere. He stays in three different houses to confuse potential attackers.
''They said they have nothing for Iraqis,'' said Amar, sitting in a small house in western Baghdad. ''We feel just like stupid trash.''
Until recently, the administration did not appear to understand the gravity of the problem. State Department officials say they are now open to increasing the number of refugee slots the administration formally requested for Iraqis in September. That request already allows for as many as 20,000 more refugees from unspecified countries.
But advocates for refugees say that such an increase is unlikely if no special measures are taken, namely designating Iraqis as a group in peril and formalizing a system for receiving them.
Ellen R. Sauerbrey, the assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration, said the United States was hoping to identify the most vulnerable Iraqi refugees but was also dependent on the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to do that.
Officials at the United Nations refugee branch acknowledge that they have moved slowly in identifying refugees, largely because of procedural obstacles and lack of money. The agency's budget for Syria last year was $700,000, less than one dollar for each Iraqi refugee in that country. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said in October that its Iraq program was $9 million short and that some employees were going without salaries.
The State Department spent $35 million on Iraqi refugees in Iraq and the region in 2006. The United States spends approximately $8 billion a month on the war.
But there is no legal requirement for the United States to rely on the United Nations. It has run its own programs in the past, notably in Southeast Asia. Hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese were ultimately resettled in the United States after the American withdrawal from Vietnam in 1975. In that instance, a number of aid groups in neighboring countries divided the work of interviewing and assessing refugees, a system Ms. Limón and many other advocates for refugees are pushing for Iraqis today.
The United States has even run similar programs in Iraq, helping to resettle about 40,000 Iraqi refugees in the United States and other countries after a failed uprising against Saddam Hussein in 1991. In 1996, about 6,500 Iraqis who had links to an American-sponsored coup attempt against Mr. Hussein were granted asylum.
The Bush administration suspended resettlement of Iraqi refugees after the Sept. 11 attacks, and it did not resume until April 2005, after the process had begun for other Arab countries. A total of 198 Iraqis were resettled in the United States as refugees in the fiscal year of 2005, and 202 in 2006, but most were in the pipeline before the 2003 invasion, and few of the cases address the increasingly dire situation for Iraqis today.
Iraqis who work with the military often have to live separately from their families, to avoid putting them in danger. One 25-year-old interpreter left home when his parents in Mosul, in northern Iraq, learned of his work. Now in Baghdad, he has been back home rarely.
Laith lives with an aunt, away from his wife, in an area where no one knows him. After a visit to his parents several months ago, a stranger asked about his 8-year-old brother at a boys' school. The family fears that it was the early stages of a kidnapping.
''I bring a lot of troubles when I go to visit my family,'' he said, smoking a cigarette.
Congress approved one program last year to help get special immigrant status for Iraqi interpreters who have worked for the United Statesmilitary. Laith has tried to apply. The law, which also applies to Afghan interpreters, is capped at 50 a year. Laith was told he needed a senior officer to vouch for him, but he has not worked with one recently, and the one he had worked with is now back in the United States.
Getting such letters, Laith said, has become increasing difficult, because the interpreters for the most senior American officers now tend to be Arabic speakers hired from the United States, not from Iraq.
The State Department has made it clear that it is deeply concerned about the fate of Iraq's religious minorities, including Christians. Officials at the department say that any refugee program must also be geared to those vulnerable groups.
As many as 100,000 exiled Iraqi Christians have relatives in the United States and would want to resettle there if given the chance, said Joseph T. Kassab, the executive director of the Chaldean Federation of America, a Michigan-based umbrella group that represents Iraqi Christians. Mr. Kassab said his group's estimates were based on questionnaires devised by University of Michigan professors and filled out by several thousand Iraqi Christian refugees in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon in recent months.
State Department officials and some advocates for refugees agree that the United States is not likely to begin resettling large numbers of Iraqis anytime soon. New counterterrorism laws after Sept. 11 have slowed immigration, particularly from countries in the Middle East, and Iraqi applications would be bogged down by those security issues.
A State Department refugee official said that any American resettlement effort would deal with only a small part of the overall refugee problem in the region.
Ms. Limón agreed, saying, ''We'll have trouble with the few thousand who work in the Green Zone.''
A quicker way to help would be to increase financing to countries that are accepting Iraqis -- Jordan, Syria and Lebanon -- and press those governments to improve their treatment of Iraqis by allowing them to work and travel, officials and advocates said.
That would be a real service for Iraqis in Jordan, who speak of rude and sometimes abusive treatment. Jordanians often do not allow Iraqis to bring in suitcases, travelers said, and have been known to turn away young men, forcing families to continue on without them.
''Put yourself in my shoes,'' said an Iraqi working in an American Army base who spent eight hours in the January cold last year with his wife and infant at the Jordanian border. ''You take your family to another country and they interview you like you are a terrorist.''
A residency permit is required, and Iraqis must deposit 50,000 Jordanian dinars -- about $70,000 -- in a bank without drawing on it for a year to obtain one. The worker, who wanted to be identified only as Abu Hussein, eventually moved his family back to Iraq, to the south, because he could not afford to stay in Jordan.
''The Americans are in control of this country,'' he said, talking about Jordan. ''Why don't they become angry at how they are treating us?''
Abu Hussein is lucky: He lives on the Army base where he works. Laith does not have that luxury. He pays $400 to two guards and a driver to bring him to Baghdad from an American base near Beiji. Insurgents pay taxi drivers near the base to call them when they see a single man with a large overnight bag, he said. Once a cab driver recognized his face.
''I worked for three years, I lost a lot of things,'' he said, his voice urgent. ''It's supposed to be some respect for me.''

President Bush began 2006 assuring the country that he had a ''strategy for victory in Iraq.'' He ended the year closeted with his war cabinet on his ranch trying to devise a new strategy, because the existing one had collapsed.
The original plan, championed by Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the top commander in Baghdad, and backed by Donald H. Rumsfeld, then the defense secretary, called for turning over responsibility for security to the Iraqis, shrinking the number of American bases and beginning the gradual withdrawal of American troops. But the plan collided with Iraq's ferocious unraveling, which took most of Mr. Bush's war council by surprise.

President Bush began 2006 assuring the country that he had a ''strategy for victory in Iraq.'' He ended the year closeted with his war cabinet on his ranch trying to devise a new strategy, because the existing one had collapsed.
The original plan, championed by Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the top commander in Baghdad, and backed by Donald H. Rumsfeld, then the defense secretary, called for turning over responsibility for security to the Iraqis, shrinking the number of American bases and beginning the gradual withdrawal of American troops. But the plan collided with Iraq's ferocious unraveling, which took most of Mr. Bush's war council by surprise.
In interviews in Washington and Baghdad, senior officials said the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department had also failed to take seriously warnings, including some from its own ambassador in Baghdad, that sectarian violence could rip the country apart and turn Mr. Bush's promise to ''clear, hold and build'' Iraqi neighborhoods and towns into an empty slogan.
This left the president and his advisers constantly lagging a step or two behind events on the ground.
''We could not clear and hold,'' Stephen J. Hadley, the president's national security adviser, acknowledged in a recent interview, in a frank admission of how American strategy had crumbled. ''Iraqi forces were not able to hold neighborhoods, and the effort to build did not show up. The sectarian violence continued to mount, so we did not make the progress on security we had hoped. We did not bring the moderate Sunnis off the fence, as we had hoped. The Shia lost patience, and began to see the militias as their protectors.''
Over the past 12 months, as optimism collided with reality, Mr. Bush increasingly found himself uneasy with General Casey's strategy. And now, as the image of Saddam Hussein at the gallows recedes, Mr. Bush seems all but certain not only to reverse the strategy that General Casey championed, but also to accelerate the general's departure from Iraq, according to senior military officials.
General Casey repeatedly argued that his plan offered the best prospect for reducing the perception that the United States remained an occupier -- and it was a path he thought matched Mr. Bush's wishes. Earlier in the year, it had.
But as Baghdad spun further out of control, some of the president's advisers now say, Mr. Bush grew concerned that General Casey, among others, had become more fixated on withdrawal than victory.
Now, having ousted Mr. Rumsfeld, Mr. Bush sees a chance to bring in a new commander as he announces a new strategy, senior military officials say. General Casey was scheduled to shift out of Iraq in the summer. But now it appears that it may happen in February or March.
By mid-September, Mr. Bush was disappointed with the results in Iraq and signed off on a complete review of Iraq strategy -- a review centered in Washington, not in Baghdad. Whatever form the new strategy takes, it seems almost certain to include a ''surge'' in forces, something that General Casey insisted earlier this year he did not need and which might even be counterproductive.
In a telephone interview on Friday, General Casey continued to caution against a lengthy expansion in the American military role. ''The longer we in the U.S. forces continue to bear the main burden of Iraq's security, it lengthens the time that the government of Iraq has to take the hard decisions about reconciliation and dealing with the militias,'' he said. ''And the other thing is that they can continue to blame us for all of Iraq's problems, which are at base their problems.''
Yet if Mr. Bush does send in more American forces, historians may well ask why it took him so long. Some Bush officials argue that the administration erred by refusing to send in a bigger force in 2003, or by sufficiently bolstering it when the insurgency began to take hold.
This year, decisions on a new strategy were clearly slowed by political calculations. Many of Mr. Bush's advisers say their timetable for completing an Iraq review had been based in part on a judgment that for Mr. Bush to have voiced doubts about his strategy before the midterm elections in November would have been politically catastrophic.
Mr. Bush came to worry that it was not just his critics and Democrats in Congress who were looking for what he dismissed last month as a strategy of ''graceful exit.'' Visiting the Pentagon a few weeks ago for a classified briefing on Iraq with his generals, Mr. Bush made it clear that he was not interested in any ideas that would simply allow American forces to stabilize the violence. Gen. James T. Conway, the Marine commandant, later told marines about the president's message.
''What I want to hear from you is how we're going to win,'' he quoted the president as warning his commanders, ''not how we're going to leave.''
Sectarian Killings Escalate
When 2006 began, the United States military did not have a systematic means of tabulating sectarian attacks in Iraq. The Sunni-led insurgency was the focus of Mr. Bush's statements, and its destruction the focus of American military strategy.
The Bush administration was jolted on Feb. 22 when Al Qaeda blew up the Askariya Mosque in Samarra, a carefully plotted effort to fan sectarian passions, prompt Shiite retaliation and make Iraq ungovernable.
The day of the explosion, Shiites in Sadr City poured into the streets carrying banners and flags. Men, some dressed in black, the traditional dress for the Shiite militia in the area, piled into open back trucks, carrying weapons and shouting slogans of loyalty to Shiite saints. In Baghdad, Zalmay Khalilzad, the American ambassador to Iraq, went to Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari to insist that the Iraqi government impose a 24-hour nationwide curfew. Mr. Jaafari, a member of the Shiite Dawa Party, was not persuaded.
''You've been here six months, and all of a sudden you know my country better than I do,'' Mr. Jaafari replied, according to an official who witnessed the exchange. But even some Iraqi leaders, including the current national security adviser, Mowaffak al-Rubaie, echoed Mr. Khalilzad's advice. ''I remember saying to him: 'this is going to be the trigger of an all-out civil war,' '' Mr. Rubaie said.
Mr. Jaafari insisted that he had a plan, which involved closing the Sunni television stations in the country, though as the violence grew he belatedly imposed a curfew that evening. It was the beginning of a debilitating pattern. The Shiite-dominated government did too little to protect Sunni citizens. Shiite militias took matters into their own hands. And the American military struggled to hold the city together with overstretched units.
It was clear that the retaliation was highly organized. Sunnis in the eastern portion of Baghdad, in an area called Rusafa, reported that Shiites in SUV's were pulling up, knocking on doors, and seeking specific people. Bodies surfaced in sewers and garbage heaps days later.
When the killing abated, President Bush and his top aides declared that the worst had passed. Both Sunnis and Shiites had ''looked into the abyss and did not like what they saw,'' the president said.
Renegade militias were a concern but ''not a major long-term problem as long as the Iraqi armed forces and the Iraqi police continue to be loyal to the central government, as they have been,'' Gen. Peter Pace, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a March 5 appearance on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press.''
Sectarian-inspired executions, however, rose from almost 200 in January to more than 700 in March, and continued upward, according to the Pentagon.
Even as the violence grew, General Casey, the top American commander in Iraq, appeared confident. He had served as a senior aide for the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon, where he gained the confidence of Mr. Rumsfeld before being sent to Baghdad in 2004. At 58, the four-star general reported directly to the defense secretary.
Mr. Rumsfeld had mused publicly that history showed that it could take a decade or so to defeat an insurgency. He was eager to turn over responsibility for the war to the Iraqis and to reduce the American footprint in Iraq as quickly as possible.
General Casey and Gen. John P. Abizaid, head of the United States Central Command, appeared to be like-minded. During the summer of 2005, General Casey had forecast ''fairly significant reductions'' in American troops by the summer of 2006, an assessment that the commander said reflected ''feelers'' from Sunni insurgents that they might be willing to negotiate and lay down their arms.
Some of General Casey's aides have said that in developing troop withdrawal plans they were cognizant that the Bush administration had not taken any steps to expand the American military presence despite a persistent insurgency, and seemed to have little appetite for substantially expanding the war effort.
No Wish to Stay Indefinitely
For his part, General Casey said that his plan was aimed at showing Iraqis that the United States did not want to perpetuate its role as an occupier indefinitely, and stressed that he was following a strategy to match the ''convoluted'' political and military situation in Iraq, and not seeking to advance his career with plans that suited the Bush administration's political agenda.
''I have worked very hard to ask for what I need, for what I thought I needed to accomplish the mission,'' he said Friday. ''It's always been my view that a heavy and sustained American military presence was not going to solve the problems in Iraq over the long term.''
By late 2005, the White House accepted the main tenets of the hand-over strategy. ''Casey and Abizaid had what seemed like a plausible plan at the time,'' Mr. Hadley recalled. ''It was well thought out, and after the elections in January looked like the direction we were headed in.''
President Bush promoted the strategy in a speech to cheering midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., on Nov. 30, 2005: ''We will continue to shift from providing security and conducting operations against the enemy nationwide to conducting more specialized operations targeted at the most dangerous terrorists. We will increasingly move out of Iraqi cities, reduce the number of bases from which we operate, and conduct fewer patrols and convoys.''
Yet not everybody at the Pentagon shared General's Casey's confidence. The Defense Intelligence Agency had briefed the White House in early 2006 that the insurgency was winning in Iraq, according to a former military officer. The briefing, which chronicled the steady rise in the number of attacks, prompted a counter-briefing from General Casey's intelligence chief, who prepared an analysis tracing the positive trends in Iraq.
Data gathered by General Casey's own command, which showed a steady increase in weekly attacks and civilian casualties, lent support to the Defense Intelligence Agency assessment.
At the State Department, skepticism about General Casey's strategy ran deep. Philip D. Zelikow, the counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice until he resigned in December, went to Iraq in late 2005, and returned with a recommendation that the first part of 2006 be devoted to a big push -- military, economic and political -- to boost the soon-to-be-formed Iraqi government. His approach contradicted the commitment to reductions.
Still, the general was reluctant to abandon his basic strategy. According to a senior administration official, General Casey told the White House in April, May and June of 2006 that the American military was having success against Al Qaeda of Mesopotamia and the Sunni-based insurgency, and that sectarian violence could be managed.
Calls for a Review of Strategy
By May 2006, uneasy officials at the State Department and the National Security Council argued for a review of Iraq strategy. A meeting was convened at Camp David to consider those approaches, according to participants in the session, but Mr. Bush left early for a secret visit to Baghdad, where he reviewed the war plans with General Casey and Mr. Maliki, and met with the American pilot whose plane's missiles killed Iraq's Al Qaeda leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. He returned to Washington in a buoyant mood.
The visit meant that the reconsideration of strategy was not as thorough as some officials hoped.
Later in June, General Casey flew to Washington to give briefings on the latest version of his troop reduction plan at the Pentagon and White House. The number of American combat brigades, which then totaled 14, would be reduced by two in September and might shrink to 10 by December, if conditions allowed. If the Iraqis continued to assume more responsibility for their security, there would be only five or six combat brigades in Iraq by December 2007.
Yet already President Bush was signaling to top aides that he wanted to re-evaluate how to keep stability before proceeding with troop withdrawals. His caution matched a growing unease among American field commanders in Iraq, and officers on the streets of Baghdad, who said they were surprised by General Casey's continued advocacy of withdrawals and consolidating bases. They said that American forces should be focusing on a greater counterinsurgency effort, which would require that a substantial number of troops be dispersed to protect that population against insurgent and militia attacks.
Events overtook the White House. In early August, the United States was forced to reverse course and add troops in Baghdad. On reflection, Mr. Hadley said, ''Finally the patience of the Shia had worn thin,'' and, ''By the time the unity government took over the cycle of sectarian violence had begun. And they and we have not been able to get ahead of it .''
The administration's summer strategy seemed simple: American and Iraqi forces would clear selected neighborhoods of insurgents and militia leaders, hold them with the Iraqi police, and win over the population with job-creating reconstruction programs.
But carrying out the strategy proved maddeningly difficult. The American troop commitment was modest at best. With the addition of roughly 7,000 troops the American military force assigned to carry out the operation in Baghdad was brought to some 15,000. (During one discussion of the operation in August, President Bush asked General Casey whether he had sufficient troops to secure Baghdad; the general assured him that he did.)
The Iraqis never delivered four of the six Iraqi Army battalions that they had committed to the effort. Some of the Iraqi police units proved to be so infiltrated by Shiite militias that they had to be pulled off duty for retraining.
Weaknesses in the Iraqi Forces
In the Sunni stronghold of Dora, in southwestern Baghdad, American troops were forced to clear thousands of homes twice: the Iraqi security forces who moved in behind them were too few, and too little dedicated to the task, to keep the insurgents from returning.
In neighborhoods like Baya, the Shiite-dominated Iraqi National Police set up menacing checkpoints on the routes Sunnis used to seek medical attention or buy fuel.
''They were trying to dominate the Sunni population and terrorize them to the point that they would leave Baghdad or leave the neighborhood,'' recalled Lt. Col. James Danna, who had led the Second Battalion, Sixth Infantry Regiment, which oversaw those areas. He said that like the first Baghdad security operation, the second also failed. As the American elections approached, White House officials say, they believed it would amount to political suicide to announce a broad reassessment of Iraq strategy. But they recognized that unless they began such a review, they would be forced to accept the conclusions of the final report of the Iraq Study Group -- headed by James A. Baker III, the former Republican secretary of state, and Lee H. Hamilton, the former Democratic congressman.
The effort started in September, around the time Mr. Bush decided to oust Mr. Rumsfeld. In the days before the election, Mr. Bush suggested during an interview that Mr. Rumsfeld could stay until the end of his term -- a deliberately misleading statement that Mr. Bush said later was necessitated by the political season. Similarly, it was days after the election that the White House revealed that a major Iraq review was under way.
In public, Mr. Bush continues to insist that he and Mr. Maliki share the same vision. In private, one of his former aides said, ''he questions whether Maliki has the will or the power'' to make good on any commitments.
American military officers have also wondered if the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government and the Americans share the same vision. Were the Iraqis not pulling their weight because they did not have the capability to provide security and proceed with reconstruction? Or did the Iraqi authorities have a sectarian agenda?
As security efforts in Baghdad faltered, a confidential briefing on possible ''end states'' in Iraq was prepared by officials under the command of Lt. Gen. Peter W. Chiarielli, who until a few weeks ago led the day-to-day operations in Iraq. It suggested the dark vision of a divided nation that haunts the administration.
Unless the United States persuaded the Iraqi government to change course, those who prepared the briefing foresaw an Iraq run by a relatively weak central government, which would include a largely autonomous nine-province Shiite region in the south and a Shiite-dominated Baghdad. The Kurds would retain their autonomy in the north. The Sunnis would essentially be relegated to the western Anbar Province and other enclaves.
The briefing posed a question: was this an outcome the United States could live with? If so, what could the United States do to minimize the bloodshed? If not, what should be done to alter this course?
Mr. Bush still insists on talking about victory, even if his own advisers differ about how to define it. ''It's a word the American people understand,'' he told members of the Iraq Study Group who came to see him at the White House in November, according to two commission members who attended. ''And if I start to change it, it will look like I'm beginning to change my policy.''

George E. Pataki holds little love for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, and has only a bit more for the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican. Still, before Gov.

Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno, meanwhile, kibitzed through the ceremonial introductions like two grizzled veterans from an era that the new whippersnapper, Mr. Spitzer, would like to retire.
During his speech, Mr. Spitzer sent an olive branch to the Legislature's two leaders by referring to them -- ''my good friend Shelly Silver, and Joe Bruno'' -- somewhat surprising words from a man who has vowed to reform the ''three men in a room'' style of governing that Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno represent.
But Mr. Silver has been Mr. Spitzer's ally and occasional foil on some issues, while Mr. Bruno has said he would work well with the new governor, but Mr. Bruno also faces an uncertain future, now that he is under investigation for his outside consulting work.
And as far as Mr. Pataki is concerned? Mr. Spitzer thanked the departing governor for his ''careful stewardship'' of the state for the last 12 years, a compliment that had a robotic quality.

The Fish and Eel Team
It's rare for two species to help each other while hunting, and it's easy to understand why. Cooperation during the hunt would turn to competition with disputes over the spoils. (Humans and dogs are one species pair that do work together, but there is no dispute over who gets what.)
Now, cooperative hunting has been found for the first time among two species of fish. Redouan Bshary of the University of Neuchâtel in Switzerland and colleagues observed coordinated behavior among groupers and giant moray eels around coral reefs in the Red Sea.
The two are made for each other. Both eat small reef fish, but they hang out in different places: groupers in open water just off a reef, morays in reef nooks and crannies. If a reef fish encounters a moray, it may swim into open water and encounter a grouper. On the other hand, a fish hoping to escape a grouper by swimming into the reef may encounter a moray.
As described in the online journal PLoS Biology, the researchers observed groupers and morays together more often than would be expected by random chance. Occasionally, a grouper would swim past a moray and vigorously shake its head. (A video is at nytimes.com/science.) That, presumably, was a signal to cooperate: the two fish would then swim together, for up to 44 minutes.
The groupers captured more prey in a given amount of time when hunting with morays than without. Morays, too, were successful in the hunt. Both groupers and morays immediately swallowed their prey whole, and the researchers suggested this may be one reason that their cooperative behavior is successful: there is never a carcass to fight over.
Sauropod Mystery Stones
The sauropod dinosaurs were the largest land creatures ever, with some specimens tipping the scales at up to 60,000 pounds.
They were vegetarians, however, and scientists have long wondered how they could have eaten enough to grow so big. They had small heads and pointy teeth, ill-suited to mashing up the large quantities of vegetation needed. So some scientists have suggested that the dinosaurs must have swallowed stones and used them to grind up the food, much the way modern birds do in their gizzards. Such stones, or gastroliths, have been found in fossil sauropods.
But a new study by Oliver Wings and P. Martin Sander of the University of Bonn in Germany makes the case that these fossil gastroliths were not part of any dinosaur food mill.
In the study, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, the researchers conducted experiments with ostriches. Though an ostrich is no dinosaur, birds may be the dinosaurs' closest living relatives. And the ostrich, as the largest plant-eating bird, has a well-developed food mill in its gizzard.
The researchers allowed the ostriches to swallow stones of different types, and measured how much the stones changed over time. They found that the stones were rapidly abraded, and thus retained a dull appearance. Dinosaur gastroliths, by contrast, are highly polished, indicating much slower abrasion.
In ostriches, gastroliths account for about 1 percent of body weight. In the few sauropod fossils with gastroliths, the figure is less than 0.1 percent, which means there would not have been enough of the stones to do much grinding.
The researchers suggested that the sauropods swallowed stones by accident, or for their mineral content. And they say the dinosaurs may have extracted maximum nutrients from food by retaining the stones for a long time, which their large size would have enabled.
Planet Scope
The search for planets outside the solar system got a boost last week with the successful launching of a French satellite from Kazakhstan.
The satellite, called Corot, carries a small telescope designed to detect the slight changes in starlight caused by the passage of a planet. The hope is that it will find smaller Earth-like planets; almost all of the extrasolar planets discovered so far have been gaseous giants.
Squirrels That Predict the Future
It's like the Beach Boys said: Catch a wave and you're sitting on top of the world.
For red squirrels in the Canadian Yukon and Europe, the wave in question is an overabundance of seed cones from spruce trees. Researchers report that the squirrels are able to predict when the trees will provide such copious amounts of food, and produce two consecutive litters just at the right time to take advantage of it.
Many trees produce relatively little seed in most years, which helps keep the populations of seed-consuming animals down. In certain years, the trees produce large amounts of seed, an event known as masting. With the seed eaters' numbers reduced, having so much seed ensures that more of it will not be eaten and will have the chance to grow.
It's a ''swamp and starve'' strategy, said Stan Boutin of the University of Alberta, lead author of a study on the squirrels in the journal Science. Most years, the trees starve the animals, and then they swamp them with food. ''The predators don't have time to respond,'' he said.
But the squirrels are different, said Dr. Boutin, who has studied them in the Yukon for two decades. They know in advance when a mast year will occur, and after they have a first litter, the mothers interrupt their weaning and conceive a second one. ''The squirrels time it so they have the maximum number of members in the population right when they can take advantage of that seed,'' Dr. Boutin said.
Having an abundance of seed cones is critical for the young squirrels' survival because it helps them break into a highly territorial system. ''It's such a big win for these females to produce that second litter,'' Dr. Boutin said.
How the squirrels know that a masting event is going to occur is a mystery, but Dr. Boutin said they may get cues from buds the trees produce 18 months before. In a masting year, most of the buds will become cones, not new branches. The squirrels may be able to tell visually that the buds will become cones, or they may get chemical cues, in the form of plant hormones, when they eat some.
Dr. Boutin said he and colleagues will study whether this ''anticipatory reproduction'' occurs in other animals. ''It could simply be that researchers have never thought to look because they have thought that this is an impossibility,'' he said.

The S.U.V., a Toyota 4Runner, was westbound on I-78 when it went off the road into a wooded area, Sergeant Hengemuhle said. It traveled about 200 feet before hitting a tree head on, she said.
The cause of the accident was under investigation, though alcohol did not appear to have played a role, Sergeant Hengemuhle said.

But it was clear, as Mr. Spitzer delivered his inaugural address on Monday that despite his campaign pledge that ''Day 1, Everything Changes,'' many things in Albany, a famously change-averse place, remain stubbornly the same.
Sitting right in front of Mr. Spitzer, and not always looking very pleased, were two of the three men who have controlled the Capitol during its years of political gridlock: Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno.
And New York is still facing the challenges that have bedeviled its last few governors: a deeply depressed upstate economy, struggling schools and mounting health care costs, some of the highest taxes in the nation, and a state government that has been seemingly unable to tackle many of these problems because of its chronic dysfunction.
Enter Mr. Spitzer, vowing change and calling his election a mandate.
''We chose pragmatism and ethics over partisan politics and dysfunction, and we demanded an end to gridlock,'' Mr. Spitzer told the crowd in his inaugural address, winning loud applause from the audience, but stony silence from Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver, who looked on impassively from their seats in the front row on the stage.
But the collision of three very different scandals last month, coming just as a reform-minded governor was about to take office, is posing the greatest threat in decades to the culture of a state capital that critics say has increasingly fallen under the spell of lobbyists, campaign donors and lawmakers who put their political survival first.
Mr. Bruno is enmeshed in a widening criminal investigation into his business ties to people seeking state money or actions.
An important ally of Mr. Spitzer's, State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, resigned in disgrace after admitting to using a state worker as a personal aide for his wife. And federal prosecutors are showing a newfound zeal for taking on corruption in Albany with the indictment of a state senator for what they called an abuse of a hallowed Albany tradition: pork-barrel spending.
Taken together, the three scandals make it much harder to argue for maintaining the status quo here. And Mr. Spitzer made it clear in his inaugural that he intends to keep pushing for changes.
''In order to return to the policies of opportunity and prosperity,'' the new governor said, ''we must change the ethics of Albany and end the politics of cynicism and division in our state.''
If history is any guide, Mr. Spitzer will be successful in pushing through some of his reforms and programs, as other governors have been able to seize on crises to enact ambitious changes. And many set the tone at their inaugurations.
More than a century ago, Theodore Roosevelt warned when he was inaugurated governor that ''it is absolutely impossible for a republic long to endure if it becomes either corrupt or cowardly.'' He went on to overhaul the civil service laws.
More recently, Hugh L. Carey said in his first State of the State address in 1975 that ''the times of plenty, the days of wine and roses, are over'' before shepherding New York City through its fiscal crisis. When Mario M. Cuomo evoked the ''family of New York'' at his inauguration in 1983, he offered a liberal alternative to the conservative ideology of the Reagan era. And George E. Pataki spoke of ''the revolutionary spirit of Saratoga,'' a turning point in the American Revolution, to call for smaller government at his inaugural, before pushing spending and tax cuts through a skeptical Assembly.
Governor Spitzer is making the case that the Capitol must clean itself up if it is to successfully address the challenges the state faces in educating its children, providing health care for the uninsured, shoring up the desperate upstate economy and holding on to businesses and residents burdened by some of the highest taxes in the country.
With last month's scandals, there have now been at least 10 state lawmakers who have been investigated, indicted or convicted in recent years. Assemblyman Brian M. McLaughlin, a Queens Democrat, was accused last year of illegally obtaining $2.2 million, and even charged with making an aide take his E-ZPass to Albany to make it appear that he had gone to the Capitol so he could bill the state for the daily allowances that lawmakers get when they are in session. And Assemblywoman Diane M. Gordon was overwhelmingly re-elected in November even though she was charged in July with seeking bribes -- in the form of a house -- from a developer seeking city land.
Some of Mr. Spitzer's proposals -- adding teeth to the state's ethics laws, overhauling its lax campaign finance laws, ending the gerrymandering that has long insulated lawmakers from competitive elections -- will be a tough sell in a Legislature that is all about protecting its incumbents. But the recent spate of bad news out of Albany -- where swapping rumors about subpoenas has supplanted the usual political chitchat -- had been good news for Mr. Spitzer, giving an added sense of urgency to his proposals.
Mr. Spitzer's pitch on Monday was that a more ethical, accountable government would lead to better policies. ''Some public officials may not want to face stricter ethics rules and more competitive elections,'' he said, ''but all citizens will win when we finally get a government that puts the people's interests, openness and integrity first.''
Bruce N. Gyory, a lawyer, lobbyist and student of New York political history who attended the speech, said Mr. Spitzer seemed to be calling for the kind of purposeful reform that will lead to new policies, in the mold of the changes that Alfred E. Smith pushed through as governor.
''He poured a very good foundation,'' Mr. Gyory said of the speech. ''Now the question becomes: Will he be able to match today's excellent start with the governmental architecture and the political pillars to sustain what he's trying to do?''

The sites were not glamorous -- a raceway in Yonkers, a union hall in Hauppauge on Long Island, the Emerald Queen Casino in Tacoma, Wash. -- and the pay was not great, either. He earned anywhere from $50 to $12,000 per fight, and sometimes a night at a discount motel and a day's worth of meal vouchers.
Still, Kemal Kolenovic loved the fighting life unequivocally. At age 28, his record was fairly unremarkable: 10 victories, 6 losses and 2 draws with nine years under his belt as a professional boxer. But even those numbers, if looked at a certain way, owed something to an attitude that valued enthusiasm over rigor and reduced the science of a boxing match to youthful play.
Kemal Kolenovic, 28, who was killed in the Bronx, was remembered as a man who loved the fighting life unequivocally.
The sites were not glamorous -- a raceway in Yonkers, a union hall in Hauppauge on Long Island, the Emerald Queen Casino in Tacoma, Wash. -- and the pay was not great, either. He earned anywhere from $50 to $12,000 per fight, and sometimes a night at a discount motel and a day's worth of meal vouchers.
Still, Kemal Kolenovic loved the fighting life unequivocally. At age 28, his record was fairly unremarkable: 10 victories, 6 losses and 2 draws with nine years under his belt as a professional boxer. But even those numbers, if looked at a certain way, owed something to an attitude that valued enthusiasm over rigor and reduced the science of a boxing match to youthful play.
''He was an all-out brawler, not much of a technical boxer, but he had a blast just throwing punches, and he was good at it,'' said Tony Kalaj, a friend who works for Joe DeGuardia's Star Boxing, a fight promotion company. ''The record? It was hard for him to get fights with his style. He made opponents look stupid.''
Two days ago in the Bronx, Mr. Kolenovic was killed after a barroom brawl in which the police said he had not participated. Sometime after 4:30 a.m. on Sunday, he was run over by a man driving a sport utility vehicle. The man was fleeing the Moonlight Restaurant and Bar on Belmont Avenue, where he and others, but not Mr. Kolenovic, had argued over which Albanian surnames were most associated with tougher and generally superior people.
The men had taken the fight outside. Mr. Kolenovic, who was at the Moonlight with an uncle, Tony Mujovic, 35, had eventually followed them onto the sidewalk and joined a group that had gathered, perhaps just to see what was going on or perhaps, Mr. Mujovic said, to try to get them to break it up. One of the men climbed into a dark sport utility vehicle and plowed into the crowd. The driver fled, and the police said last night that he was still at large.
The S.U.V. hit Mr. Kolenovic and threw him headfirst into a tree. He was pronounced dead shortly afterward at St. Barnabas Hospital.
''We sat around reviewing what the security camera got,'' said Al Kolenovic, a cousin. ''You see Kemal sitting outside, wanting to leave. The poor guy's got his hands in his pockets, with his back to the car. He didn't know what hit him.''
Yesterday at midday, three or four dozen men who said they were cousins of Mr. Kolenovic gathered in Astoria, Queens, at the Islamic Unity and Culture Center of Plav-Gusinje, a Muslim mosque that serves the city's Montenegrin community.
About half of them sat around folding tables in the basement; the rest spilled outside, onto the corner of 12th Street and 31st Avenue. They were long-faced and mostly with dark hair, and a good number of them smoked cigarettes in the rain. The women in their lives -- sisters, spouses, mothers -- were inside, upstairs with scarves over their heads, kneeling in front of prayer mats.
''Right now, it's the women's turn,'' Al Kolenovic said. ''And then the men again. Both groups do it five times a day until the deceased has his burial. Pretty sad story.''
He said the burial was to take place today at a Balkan cemetery in Monticello, N.Y., pending the approval of the boxer's mother, Sanija Kolenovic. She flew from her home in Germany and was due to arrive at the mosque at any minute.
Several friends from the boxing community had been by to pay their respects, including Elvir Muriqi, an Albanian whose boxing nickname is the Kosovo Kid. Joe Antonacci, a ring announcer, described Mr. Kolenovic as ''a beautiful person in a brutal, lonely, thankless game.''
''He had such charisma in the ring,'' Mr. Antonacci went on. ''He looked like Brian Setzer from the Stray Cats -- that blond hair combed back. He had a big Albanian following, obviously. But he couldn't go into an arena and not make fans. He was a nonstop movement fighter, fast hands, lots of spirit.''
Mr. Kolenovic fought as a welterweight. He was 5-foot-7 and weighed about 150 pounds. He came to Brooklyn from Montenegro in 1993, when he was 14 or 15, without his parents. He worked construction and washed dishes in restaurants to pay rent. He lived in Midwood.
Mr. Kolenovic worked with a few trainers in his career. The last was Chelo Betancourt, who worked with him at Gleason's Gym in Dumbo.
''He was such a tough kid, a lot of championship fighters liked to spar with him because he could take it and he could adjust his style to match any fighter,'' Mr. Betancourt said. ''Antonio Diaz brought him out to Texas when he was training for a title fight, paid him $150 a day to stay out there and spar for a few weeks.''
In 2003, Mr. Kolenovic beat Fontaine Cabell for the New York State welterweight title. ''The promoters were looking for a walkover opponent, but we prepared good,'' Mr. Betancourt said. He said that Mr. Kolenovic won by technical knockout ''by counterpunching the whole way,'' and that ''he shocked everybody.''
The following year, Mr. Kolenovic lost his title defense, also by technical knockout. Mr. Betancourt said that he was underprepared because he had been spending more time drinking with friends than in the gym, and that he had advised him not to take the fight when he did.
At times, said Mr. Kalaj, the promoter: ''They threw him in with the wolves. He got robbed a lot by hometown referees.''
Around 3 p.m. yesterday, the car driving Mr. Kolenovic's mother pulled up at the mosque. She sobbed as she was escorted inside and up the stairs. When she approached her son's body in the open coffin, she clutched her head, dropped to her knees, and screamed.
All the men upstairs stood at the side of the room, while the women surrounded Mr. Kolenovic's body, also crying. Mrs. Kolenovic, who cried the loudest, took her son's face in her hands and held it.

Public School 64, a vacant building with a leaky roof, broken windows and a colony of pigeons, sits on East Ninth Street near Tompkins Square Park at the center of one of the last fights against gentrification in Manhattan.
Since 1998, it has touched off pitched battles in the neighborhood, embroiling two mayoral administrations and employing a legion of lawyers and fixers, all for naught. In November, vandals broke in and painted the walls with another layer of anti-landlord graffiti.
For eight years, a vacant building has been at the center of one of the last fights against gentrification in Manhattan.
Public School 64, a vacant building with a leaky roof, broken windows and a colony of pigeons, sits on East Ninth Street near Tompkins Square Park at the center of one of the last fights against gentrification in Manhattan.
Since 1998, it has touched off pitched battles in the neighborhood, embroiling two mayoral administrations and employing a legion of lawyers and fixers, all for naught. In November, vandals broke in and painted the walls with another layer of anti-landlord graffiti.
Gregg Singer, the small-time developer who bought the building, which runs from Ninth Street to 10th Street, for $3.15 million at a city auction, says he has been stymied at every turn from renovating the building for elderly tenants, nonprofit organizations or college dormitories. He said he was the victim of a political deal between Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and a former city councilwoman, Margarita López.
Mr. Singer's opponents view him as an interloper with little respect for the needs of the community or the building's history as a political and cultural center for the East Village and Lower East Side. They say his secret intention is to build luxury housing.
The opponents include not only neighborhood activists but nearly every local elected official, the pro-development Bloomberg administration and the owner of the penthouse next door at the Christadora House, a 1980s symbol of encroaching gentrification where protesters once chanted, ''Kill yuppie scum.'' The 16-story, 79-year-old apartment building originally housed a charity by the same name that helped immigrants adjust to life in New York.
More than eight years after Mr. Singer bought the building, there is no end in sight. P.S. 64 is a blight even as Tompkins Square Park, the site of a homeless encampment and riot in 1988, has been transformed into a quiet oasis for the white-collar professionals who live nearby.
''It's an amazing tale,'' said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York. ''Whatever you believe, the fact that this has dragged on so long is amazing. The property continues to be an eyesore and a wasted opportunity in the neighborhood.''
Mr. Singer has filed three lawsuits against the city, including one (filed by Randy M. Mastro, a deputy mayor under Rudolph W. Giuliani) that seeks $100 million in damages, claiming Mr. Bloomberg ''cut a dirty political deal with the local city councilwoman at the time, Margarita López: In exchange for her support of his re-election bid, he would see to it that his administration blocked the owner's development plans.''
Last year, the city declared the building a landmark, an example of the French Renaissance Revival style. It now plans to change the zoning to eliminate most development options.
''For the government to sell me the building and then landmark it, it's like bait and switch,'' Mr. Singer said. ''Complaints from the community don't bother me. It's the government that's the problem. They've blocked me from doing any useful development here.''
City officials called his claims nonsense and have asked that the suit be dismissed. Virginia Waters, a city lawyer, said that Mr. Singer could use the building for a medical or community center, or a dormitory, so long as the city is assured it would be occupied by students.
''The city has in no way prohibited those uses from going forward,'' she said. ''However, we have read that he wants an exorbitant rent. That may be his problem.''
Ms. López, who was appointed last April to the city's Housing Authority by Mr. Bloomberg, did not return calls about the controversy.
The atmosphere is poisonous. One flier likened Mr. Singer's dormitory design to a Nazi concentration camp; another invited people to toss dog droppings over the construction fence.
More recently, Mr. Singer put up his own posters announcing that the ''Christotora Treatment Center,'' for the homeless, drug addicted and recently paroled, was ''coming soon.'' And he set off a furor when he used an old permit to alter the outside of the building to buttress his suit challenging landmark designation.
''Singer's been combative from the beginning,'' said David McWater, the chairman of Community Board 3, which includes Ninth Street. ''He thinks it's his God-given right to make as much money as he can.''
There was little question that Mr. Singer had stepped onto a minefield when he outbid a dozen rival bidders in July 1998 at an city auction. Police officers offered to escort him past an angry group of protesters.
It took a year to close on the property, which Mr. Singer says is now worth $51 million, though the effect of landmark status is unclear. The building came with a deed restriction: It must be used as a ''community facility,'' including a library, nursing home or clinic, or for social service or arts groups.
The original opposition to the sale was led by Armando Perez and Chino Garcia of Charas, a community group that established the El Bohio Cultural and Community Center in the building after P.S. 64 closed in 1977. Over time, it became a home for housing activists, artists, theater groups, a bicycle repair shop and the Latin Kings, a notorious street gang.
The school is ''symbolic of the struggle in our community,'' said Councilwoman Rosie Mendez, Ms. López's successor. ''When everyone else fled the community during the 1970s, we took out the rubble and created community gardens, affordable housing. He can move forward on developing this as a community facility, or he can decide to sell it.''
In 1997, Antonio Pagán, who had clashed with Charas and who was then the local city councilman, urged the Giuliani administration to auction the property. The fight to ''save'' P.S. 64 became a cause célèbre among local groups, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund, the actress Susan Sarandon and Ms. López, a friend of Mr. Perez's who later succeeded Mr. Pagán on the Council.
Mr. Singer's first move was to evict Charas. That took more than two years and 110 police officers to haul away protesters who had chained themselves together.
''The anger wasn't at Gregg, per se,'' said Lyn Pentecost, executive director of the Lower East Side Girls Club. But he had ''stepped into the thick of community politics.''
At one point, Ms. Pentecost said, she offered to buy a third of the building for the Girls Club for $3 million. She said Mr. Singer was interested only in leasing it.
''He's an opportunist,'' said Valerio Orselli, a member of Charas. ''I don't believe for a minute that Mr. Singer intended it to be the community center we envisioned.''
The developer tells a different story: He says that Ms. López warned the Girls Club, and many other nonprofits, not to get involved with him. He said 108 schools and nonprofit and social service organizations responded to an appeal he sent to 1,000 groups, but they all backed out.
No doubt some potential tenants who visited the building were scared off by the frequent protests outside, so perhaps New York University, the New School and the New York Society for the Deaf decided to sidestep a volatile situation.
John Caizzo, a vice president at the DeMatteis Organization, who decided on a different site for his company's project, acknowledged that the building ''seems like a hot potato.'' But no city officials told him to stay away, he said.
But Cecilia Abrilla, a director of the Puerto Rican Alliance, on the Lower East Side, wrote to Mr. Singer in 2003 saying Ms. López ''has cast a warning to the nonprofit community to stay away from Mr. Singer'' by threatening to withdraw financial support for the organizations.
And a top city official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the litigation made it clear that the local community effectively has veto power. ''At the end of the day,'' the official said, Mr. Singer ''will have to find an accommodation with the community.''
After a series of meetings in 2004 with Robert B. Tierney, chairman of the Landmarks Commission, Mr. Singer devised a plan to preserve the Ninth Street side of the old school while building a 19-story dormitory tower at the rear. He said as much as $2 million a year in excess revenue would flow to local groups. In return, according to the lawsuit, Mr. Tierney promised to refrain from landmarking and support a building permit.
But the proposal ignited broader opposition, and the Buildings Department denied him a permit after imposing what Mr. Singer called ''an unprecedented requirement'' that he prove that he had a contract with a specific school for the housing. City officials said they imposed the rule after unscrupulous developers had tried to convert ''dormitories'' into market-rate housing.
Days later, Mr. Singer said, Ms. López, a Democrat, announced her endorsement of Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican with whom she had quarreled, rather than the challenger, Fernando Ferrer.
Michael Rosen, who lives in the penthouse at Christadora House, formed a new group that lobbied to designate the school a city landmark. ''The thought of a dormitory, tall or short, was out of place in this neighborhood,'' he said, adding, ''My hope is that the building comes back to serve people who are in need.''
Mr. Singer scoffed, saying Mr. Rosen did not want his views blocked.
In June, the Landmarks Commission voted to designate P.S. 64 a landmark, over the objection of the Real Estate Board, a powerful lobbying organization. ''The building should never have been landmarked,'' Mr. Spinola, the board's president, said.
Further, he said, the city's new requirement for dormitories was tantamount to ''telling a commercial developer he must have leases before they'll give him a permit.''
City lawyers denied many of Mr. Singer's assertions. ''Landmarks never had a deal with him,'' said Gabriel Taussig of the Law Department. ''He had nothing in writing.''
Mr. Singer sued over the permit denial and lost. He is appealing.
The first, and so far only, attempt at a settlement came in July, when Mr. Singer met with Ms. Mendez, United States Representative Nydia Velázquez and a lawyer for the city. The two sides explored a proposal for Mr. Singer to provide space for community groups while he built apartments in the rest of the building.
The talks quickly collapsed, with each side blaming the other. That is when Mr. Singer stripped terra cotta elements and copper cornices from the building's exterior, a move the politicians saw as a breach of faith.
''I'm disappointed that all the negotiations have broken down,'' said William Jones, pastor of the Gospel Fellowship Church nearby. ''I would've been thrilled if there was a compromise that allowed residential development and community space.''

Inside a Philip Johnson-designed office tower in Boston's financial district, UBS, the giant Swiss bank, is running a ''hedge fund hotel.''
Like a few other big investment banks, UBS leases space to ambitious young hedge fund traders as a temporary home, complete with receptionists, espresso machines and consultants to help manage their information systems.
Regulators are growing concerned about banks that lease office space to hedge funds in hopes of gaining big clients.
Inside a Philip Johnson-designed office tower in Boston's financial district, UBS, the giant Swiss bank, is running a ''hedge fund hotel.''
Like a few other big investment banks, UBS leases space to ambitious young hedge fund traders as a temporary home, complete with receptionists, espresso machines and consultants to help manage their information systems.
In return, the banks hope the hedge fund hotel guests may become big clients.
Some regulators, however, are growing concerned about the relationship between the banks and their hedge fund hotel guests, looking at whether the banks might be using the real estate relationship as a way to entice hedge funds to do business with them, possibly at the expense of their investors.
William F. Galvin, the Massachusetts secretary of state, has subpoenaed UBS and is examining other banks with hedge fund hotels in Boston to determine how they are charging for their services. He is looking at whether hedge funds are paying higher than normal trading fees to banks to compensate them for the office space and failing to disclose this expense to investors.
''It's a conflict of interest issue,'' Mr. Galvin said.
UBS, which declined to comment, is the leader in this business, with 400,000 square feet of hedge fund hotels in a number of cities. Bear Stearns is also active, with space for rent in New York, Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles.
While the state investigation is in a preliminary stage and may not lead to any specific charges, at its heart is a thorny issue that has dogged regulators for decades. Money managers, including mutual funds and hedge funds, often pay Wall Street with ''soft dollars'' -- inflated commissions that include the cost of trading (typically 1 to 2 cents a share) plus an additional few cents a share that can be directed to pay for research and other services.
Soft dollars are controversial because clients pay for the higher commissions, while the services often benefit the manager the most. Higher commissions result in greater expenses for the fund and potentially lower returns for investors.
In the late 1990s, the Securities and Exchange Commission cracked down on the use of soft dollars by mutual funds, concerned that investors were being duped into paying for services enjoyed by the manager.
Massachusetts is now investigating whether hedge funds are improperly using soft dollars to pay for space in these hotels and failing to disclose to investors that they are covering a major expense.
''It's the same soft dollar question,'' Mr. Galvin said in an interview. ''What kind of quid pro quo might be in the placement of an order? What's the relationship between the entities?''
As hedge funds have exploded, so, too, have the fortunes of Wall Street, which earns billions of dollars a year in fees executing trades and lending money to hedge fund clients. Hedge funds typically trade more than other Wall Street clients and they trade exotic, high-margin products, like complex derivatives.
Because hedge funds have become such important customers, there are concerns that they may be receiving tips about pending mergers, for example, or other yet-to-be-disclosed news that could affect a stock price. Trading ahead of public disclosure would give a fund an advantage; while it generally would be illegal, it is often hard for regulators to detect or prove.
Trading and the soft dollars used to pay for it are only one part of the business Wall Street does with hedge funds. The main business of servicing hedge funds is called prime brokerage. It includes financing trades; finding and lending stock to allow hedge funds to short stocks (betting that their price will fall); structuring derivatives; and executing swaps. It can also include hedge fund hotels -- securing real estate, receptionists and information technology and even managing, say, the risk of trading currencies in Asia.
The global prime brokerage business generates $8 billion to $10 billion a year, according to an estimate by the Vodia Group, a consulting firm for the financial services industry. The business is highly profitable, with a return on equity -- a measure of how efficiently the bank reinvests its capital -- of a healthy 15 to 20 percent. In 2006, Goldman Sachs made $2 billion directly servicing hedge funds, 22 percent more than the previous year.
Prime brokerage is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the fees that hedge funds generate for Wall Street firms: billions of additional dollars come from trading for these funds. Credit Suisse estimates that investment banks made $25 billion in revenue from hedge funds in 2004, $19 billion of which came from sales and trading and the rest from prime brokerage.
Hedge funds now control half the volume traded on the New York and London Stock Exchanges, according to Credit Suisse.
In markets like convertible arbitrage, hedge funds control 70 percent of the trading. (In convertible arbitrage, an investor buys a bond that can be converted into stock and then sells that stock short, betting that its price will fall because of the sale of convertible bonds.)
''Hedge funds generate about 30 to 35 percent of the equity commission volume of the major Wall Street firms,'' said Brad Hintz, a securities analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, a respected Wall Street research firm that manages money for wealthy individuals and institutions. But that is only part of the equation.
''Because a hedge fund has broad investment guidelines -- it is not constrained like a mutual fund to invest in certain stocks or certain sectors -- it allows the hedge fund to really go after some of the more financially attractive products the Street offers,'' Mr. Hintz said.
In the United States, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns lead the pack in prime brokerage, collectively controlling about 75 percent of the market, according to Sanford C. Bernstein, a unit of AllianceBernstein.
But neither Goldman nor Morgan Stanley run significant hedge fund hotel operations. (Goldman inherited a small business from Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, which it bought in 2000.)
Bear Stearns' hedge fund hotel clients tend to be small. Bear is unusual because it accepts only ''hard dollar'' arrangements, rather then venturing into the murky area of soft dollars.
Bank of America exited the hedge fund hotel business 18 months ago because of a lack of demand.
Lehman Brothers and Credit Suisse have been building their prime brokerage businesses. Lehman has space that it leases to a select group of clients, but it is not a major player in hotel space. Credit Suisse prefers to cater to a small number of institutional-quality hedge funds that are expanding into high-margin products like structured derivatives and reinsurance.
Jefferies, a bank that caters to midmarket clients, recruited a significant part of Bank of America's prime brokerage team to build its business. Glen Dailey, head of prime brokerage, said the hedge fund hotel business was too expensive to build at Bank of America.
''It took a lot of resources, especially tech support,'' Mr. Dailey said. ''Clients would call because there wasn't coffee or hot water. In the end, we felt like the client service group was spending 80 percent of its time on the real estate.''

Eliot Spitzer ended 12 years of Republican rule here on Monday with a blunt critique of the past and a call to ''end the politics of cynicism and division in our state.''
With his predecessor, George E. Pataki, gamely looking on, Governor Spitzer said in his 20-minute inaugural address that New York, ''like Rip van Winkle,'' had ''slept through much of the past decade.'' He pledged to undertake reforms ''substantial in size and historic in scope'' and hinted at some of the contentious battles to come, including his plans to reshape state Medicaid and ethics policies.
Eliot Spitzer ended 12 years of Republican rule here on Monday with a blunt critique of the past and a call to ''end the politics of cynicism and division in our state.''
With his predecessor, George E. Pataki, gamely looking on, Governor Spitzer said in his 20-minute inaugural address that New York, ''like Rip van Winkle,'' had ''slept through much of the past decade.'' He pledged to undertake reforms ''substantial in size and historic in scope'' and hinted at some of the contentious battles to come, including his plans to reshape state Medicaid and ethics policies.
The speech was the beginning salvo in what many see as a gargantuan challenge Mr. Spitzer has set out for himself -- to overhaul a state government paralyzed by gridlock and consumed by recurring scandals. [News analysis, Page B1.]
Yet Mr. Spitzer's work began hours before the speech: He signed five executive orders before 9 a.m., including directives establishing new ethical guidelines for state workers, among them a ban on accepting almost any gifts, as well as new restrictions on lobbying and the use of state resources. He also barred elected officials or candidates from appearing in advertisements paid for by state entities, a frequent practice of Mr. Pataki.
In his speech, Mr. Spitzer, 47, laid out what he said were ''two overarching objectives'': making the government ''ethical and wise,'' and rebuilding the economy. He has said that addressing the struggling upstate economy would be a particular priority, but acknowledged the difficulty in reviving regions like the Buffalo area that have seen an exodus of manufacturing jobs.
The speech capped a whirlwind day in which the new governor took the official oath of office at midnight and, after sleeping about three hours, arose for a two-mile run through a chilly Albany rain. The rain stopped before the inauguration, though temperatures stayed in the 40s. After his 1 p.m. address, he revived an Albany tradition by opening the Executive Mansion to the public, and he and his wife, Silda Wall Spitzer, received 1,200 well-wishers. The inaugural speech was itself a break with tradition in that it was held outdoors, with Mr. Spitzer clad in a suit but no overcoat for the hourlong ceremony.
The change of leadership seemed to electrify a capital that has had Mr. Pataki as its governor for the last 12 years. Democrats were elated at the prospect of being at the seat of power for the first time since Mario M. Cuomo was voted out of office in 1994, while Republicans feared that Mr. Spitzer's ascension could weaken their already tenuous hold on the State Senate, their only redoubt of power. Lobbyists, gathering for the legislative session that begins this week, worried about how the new power structure would affect their work.
Hovering over the inauguration was the fallout from the ethical scandals that have enveloped Albany. Only three of the four statewide officials elected in November took their oaths, because the comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, resigned late last month and pleaded guilty to a felony after admitting to using state workers to chauffeur and act as companions for his ailing wife.
One of Mr. Spitzer's executive orders, prohibiting the use of state property, including vehicles, computers and telephones, for nonofficial business, seemed aimed at curbing such behavior. The order said that individuals authorized by their agency to use a vehicle for personal purposes ''shall keep records of such use, and the value of such personal use shall be calculated and reported as personal income.''
In his address, Mr. Spitzer said, ''Over the last decade, we have seen what can happen when our government stands still in the face of great challenge.''
''Today is the day when all of that changes,'' he added.
His pointed attacks on Albany's problems ruffled some Republican feathers.
Asked about the Rip Van Winkle line specifically, the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, now the state's top Republican, said, ''I don't agree with that.''
''I think history will judge the last 12 years, with this governor that's exiting, to have been one of the most productive 12 years for the people of New York State,'' he said. ''And history will judge that -- not rhetoric.''
Mr. Bruno and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, have essentially been running the state with Mr. Pataki for the last decade. Mr. Silver, for his part, said he took no offense, adding, ''I think it was very clear that his references were to the prior administration.''
The new governor began the new year at the Executive Mansion, where he was sworn in at midnight by Judge Robert W. Sweet of Federal District Court in Manhattan. Mr. Spitzer was once a clerk for Judge Sweet, who also swore him in later at the public inauguration.
Most of the major political figures in the state were present at the afternoon ceremony, including Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and much of the state's Congressional delegation. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton was in Washington attending memorial services for former President Gerald R. Ford. After Mr. Spitzer's speech, Judy Collins sang ''This Little Light of Mine,'' a song that had been used in one of Mr. Spitzer's political ads during the campaign.
Further symbolizing the return of Democratic rule was the swearing-in of Andrew M. Cuomo as attorney general to replace Mr. Spitzer. His father, the former governor, was by his side. David A. Paterson was sworn in as lieutenant governor, the first African-American to hold the post.
The new attorney general signaled that he, too, would begin moving to confront the ethical challenges in the capital, as Mr. Cuomo planned meetings Tuesday with the Albany Country district attorney, P. David Soares, who prosecuted Mr. Hevesi, and David Grandeau, the head of the state's Lobbying Commission.
All in all, it was a day characterized by a rush of activity in a capital where Mr. Pataki had been increasingly invisible.
In signing his executive orders, Mr. Spitzer said he was fulfilling a promise ''that one of the first acts I would take as governor, officially, was to put in place a series of ethics guidelines and strictures that would begin the process of restoring government to what it should be, which is responsive, open, transparent, available to the public.
''I am hoping that others in other branches will join me in this,'' he added.
Mr. Spitzer prohibited nepotism in hiring and contracting, and barred former state workers from lobbying the agency or authority where they worked for two years after their departure. State employment officials were also barred from asking job candidates about their party affiliation.
Mr. Spitzer also prohibited state workers from making contributions to the campaigns of the governor or lieutenant governor, or affiliated political action committees.
''I do not believe it looks proper for individuals who work for the governor, the lieutenant governor, to be making contributions,'' Mr. Spitzer said, adding, ''the appearance might be that they have been expected to do so, or it is a condition of employment. None of that should exist.''
He signed the orders on a desk once used by Theodore Roosevelt, in a room of the mansion known as the History Room, which also displays a wheelchair used by Franklin D. Roosevelt.
After Mr. Spitzer finished and had answered some questions, he strode out of the room, but he and his wife quickly came back after his dogs Jesse, a bichon frisé, and James, a wheaten terrier, bolted in and began barking at reporters, one of several appearances the dogs made throughout the day.
In his inaugural address, attempting to outline his political philosophy, Mr. Spitzer called for New York to ''embrace a progressive vision of government once more, one that upholds the values of individuality and community; of entrepreneurship and opportunity; of responsibility and fairness.''
''No one any longer believes in government as a heavy hand that can cure all our ills,'' he said, ''but rather we see it as a lean and responsive force that can make possible the pursuit of prosperity and opportunity for all, by softening life's blows, leveling its playing field and making possible the pursuit of happiness that is our God-given right.''

After serving six months for strong-arm robbery, Frank Stephens left Rikers Island nearly five years ago in the same manner as most inmates. Just as dawn broke in April, a Department of Correction van dropped the 17-year-old and about 30 other convicts at Queensborough Plaza, among the ''homeless, a lot of prostitutes, and crackheads'' on the street that morning, he said. He shared a few of his $22 with three other teenage convicts, before hopping on the train home to Brownsville, Brooklyn.
''Maybe they made it, like me,'' Mr. Stephens, now 21, said of the other convicts he was released with. ''Or, maybe they fell back into old habits.''
Young inmates who leave Rikers Island often prefer to fend for themselves even when some groups offer help in readjusting to society.
After serving six months for strong-arm robbery, Frank Stephens left Rikers Island nearly five years ago in the same manner as most inmates. Just as dawn broke in April, a Department of Correction van dropped the 17-year-old and about 30 other convicts at Queensborough Plaza, among the ''homeless, a lot of prostitutes, and crackheads'' on the street that morning, he said. He shared a few of his $22 with three other teenage convicts, before hopping on the train home to Brownsville, Brooklyn.
''Maybe they made it, like me,'' Mr. Stephens, now 21, said of the other convicts he was released with. ''Or, maybe they fell back into old habits.''
Half of all Rikers inmates serving city sentences of a year or less are back in jail within a year, according to the Correction Department. Juvenile advocates argue that Queensborough Plaza -- where they estimate 10 teenage convicts are dropped off each week -- is for many of them the first step on a path back to jail, as they slip back into the city alone, without help assimilating. Even department officials say the plaza, having always been the closest transportation hub to Rikers since it opened as a jail in 1932, is not the ideal place for any newly released convict, young or old.
''It's the time when they're most vulnerable,'' said Kathleen Coughlin, the Correction Department deputy commissioner.
Over the past three years, the Correction Department has offered adults -- who make up the bulk of the 13,500 daily inmate population at Rikers -- an alternative to being dropped off at Queensborough Plaza, in addition to the option of being picked up by friends or family.
Upon release from Rikers, adults can instead get a ride directly to job sites or aftercare programs sponsored by nonprofits. Now some nonprofits that serve the small population of young inmates at Rikers are also offering juveniles this option. Experts in the field say aftercare programs are crucial to preventing recidivism.
But while many adults embrace the opportunity, the response from young inmates has been lukewarm. It seems many, even those returning repeatedly to jail, prefer to fend for themselves.
''I'm taking a cab straight to my girlfriend's house,'' said Radell Murray, 18, an inmate who said he was serving his fourth sentence at Rikers in two years for charges including assault and selling crack.
The illusion of invincibility that plagues young inmates is mostly absent among the adult inmate population, said Merle Lefkowitz, the deputy executive director of Rikers Island Discharge Enhancement.
The Correction Department started the RIDE program for adults in 2003, shortly after its newly appointed commissioner, Martin F. Horn, met with city agencies and nonprofits to address inmate needs. Today several nonprofits with offices on Rikers Island assist adult inmates with aftercare planning and offer rides upon their release.
More than two-thirds of those released from prison or jail nationwide are readmitted within three years, Ms. Coughlin said. ''Our early numbers on this indicate that if we keep people engaged 90 days after jail, we have about a 70 percent rate of keeping them out,'' she said.
This year, for inmates age 16 to 18, the department financed the Adolescent Re-entry Initiative program, run by the nonprofit Vera Institute of Justice, Ms. Coughlin said. And two nonprofits, the Fortune Society and Friends of Island Academy, each recently bought vans to transport juveniles home or to their own aftercare programs.
But so far, adult inmates appear far more interested in aftercare, with half the population signing up with RIDE, Ms. Lefkowitz said. As for those who do not plan for their lives after jail, ''unfortunately, we'll have another shot at them because they'll end up back here,'' she said.
That is why juvenile advocates say they have been considering new ways to ensure that young inmates sign up for aftercare. In the past 17 years, Friends of Island Academy has provided counseling, education and job training to 4,500 young convicts who have found their way to its Midtown office, said its director, Beth Navon. The organization recently began holding a weekly outreach workshop at Island Academy, the New York City alternative high school on Rikers Island, where it is now trying to encourage young inmates to take its van directly to its offices upon their release.
On a recent Tuesday, Charles Crum, 18, an inmate, listened attentively during a ''Know Your Rights'' workshop led by a Friends of Island Academy staff member, Tongo Eisen-Martin.
Mr. Crum said that after he was kicked out of high school he began ''being bad,'' by robbing people and dealing crack. Today he is working to earn his G.E.D. at Island Academy, where peers call him ''Far Rock,'' after his neighborhood of Far Rockaway, Queens. He and a dozen others vied for Mr. Eisen-Martin's attention by shouting out personal experiences.
''They be stopping me for no reason,'' said Carlos Rivas, 18, who is serving four months for robbery. ''Sometimes they don't have anything on you, they just lie.''
''We're not constitutional superheroes; this is really all just to live to fight another day in court, you know what I'm saying?'' Mr. Eisen-Martin replied to Mr. Rivas, after explaining his rights under police questioning.
The weekly presence and persistence at the academy have persuaded some to take a chance on the van that Friends of Island Academy bought with a $10,000 private grant. And Ms. Navon said she was applying for another grant to finance an additional weekly workshop at the academy, allowing Mr. Eisen-Martin to reach out to more young inmates regarding planning for their lives after jail.
Lorenzo Ross, 18, a resident of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, serving his second sentence for gun possession, said he had planned to reform after his first stay at Rikers, ''but I repeat the same mistakes.'' When he is released in February, he said, he plans instead to take the Friends van to its office at 330 West 38th Street.
''I want to take advantage of everything they're offering,'' Mr. Ross said.
But aftercare does not work for all, Ms. Navon said. Many come from abusive or neglectful households, with little education and job training.
Of the about 800 adolescents on Rikers Island at any give time, half are junior high school dropouts and half are reading below a sixth-grade level, said Frank Dody, the principal of Island Academy.
Ms. Navon said 80 percent of those who had completed the Friends of Island Academy programs had not returned to jail.
Mr. Stephens -- who was arrested in 2002 after beating up a classmate and stealing his money during a fight in the cafeteria -- has not gone back to Rikers since he served his six-month sentence.
His parole officer referred him to Friends of Island Academy after his high school refused to readmit him.
Mr. Stephens earned his G.E.D. through Friends and now works there as a youth leader.
He said more young convicts would benefit by choosing the Friends van, ''especially teenagers whose families are blind to the fact that they're free.''
''It's sort of like somebody out there cares you're home,'' he said.

She cautioned against diverting budget surpluses to increase spending, suggested some tax increases, warned how much the unpopular Fresh Kills landfill would cost to close and even raised the possibility of imposing tolls on the free East River bridges -- all issues that most politicians would shun.
And yet, last month Ronnie Lowenstein was not only re-elected, but also won unanimously.
In the decade under Ronnie Lowenstein’s leadership, political leaders and watchdogs say that the Independent Budget Office has proven itself.
She cautioned against diverting budget surpluses to increase spending, suggested some tax increases, warned how much the unpopular Fresh Kills landfill would cost to close and even raised the possibility of imposing tolls on the free East River bridges -- all issues that most politicians would shun.
And yet, last month Ronnie Lowenstein was not only re-elected, but also won unanimously.
''Winning an election with four votes is no small thing,'' she said.
Ms. Lowenstein, a 55-year-old economist, was reappointed as director of New York City's Independent Budget Office. When the office was created 10 years ago, some city officials dismissed the position as another redundant municipal agency. But in the decade under Ms. Lowenstein's leadership, the office has proved itself, political leaders and nonprofit watchdog groups say.
''If there were any concerns that existed before, I think they have been dispelled,'' Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. said. ''An extra set of eyes is always helpful.''
Ms. Lowenstein joined the office in 1996 from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and in 2000 was named director to fill out her predecessor's unexpired term. Reappointed in 2002, she has just been named to a second four-year term by Mr. Thompson; Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum; Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker; and Helen M. Marshall of Queens on behalf of her fellow borough presidents.
Ms. Lowenstein has sought to be scrupulously neutral, even switching her voter registration from Democrat to independent (which, she acknowledged, virtually disenfranchised her in her heavily Democratic Manhattan neighborhood).
''They don't have an ax to grind,'' said Gene Russianoff, staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group, referring to the budget office staff.
Ms. Lowenstein's hope has been to position the office as honest broker in the budget debate. The office has no policy-making role but provides nonpartisan budget, economic and policy analyses to elected officials and to New Yorkers.
''It takes a long time to build credibility,'' she said. ''You're only as good as your last report.''
''The boring people like me thought we should be doing research that didn't take policy positions but just informed the debate,'' she said in an interview last week. ''Initially, we really didn't know who our audience was. We were so technical that we were virtually incomprehensible. It took us a long time to take sophisticated research and translate it in ways that made it accessible.''
By most accounts, the office succeeded, in its published and Web site versions of reports, analyses of budget options and fiscal overview. After early challenges from the Giuliani administration, she said, relations with the Bloomberg administration ''have taken another quantum step forward.''
''I admit I was one of those people who said we don't need another fiscal monitor,'' she said. ''Our goal was to become everyone's first source for objective information on taxes and budget, and I think we've done that. We're able to take on a broader range of topics that an elected official just won't touch and lay out the alternatives. Even though we don't advocate for change, those are uncomfortable things to be saying if you're an elected official.''
The City Charter guarantees the office at least 10 percent of the money allotted to the mayor's Office of Management and Budget. ''That has been a huge factor in keeping us independent,'' she said. ''We've never gotten a penny more than that.''
She cited suggestions that with additional resources, her office might delve more into measuring municipal performance, perhaps even compiling the indicators that now constitute the mayor's periodic management report.
''If that were given to us, would we do it well? Yes,'' she said, but added in her typically noncommittal way, ''Does that mean it should be? Not necessarily.''
Another of Ms. Lowenstein's goals is to make the municipal budget more transparent so government officials and citizens alike can easily determine how much the city is spending for, say, housing homeless women and how the amount compares with that of other periods.
In 2007, she said, the challenge for the city will be how to deal with an embarrassment of riches, which can pose more challenges than a deficit because of pressures to cut taxes, increase spending or take less politically popular steps to reduce the city's long-term debt.
''The city is in stronger fiscal shape than it has been for a long time,'' she said, ''but it would appear that longer term, those budget gaps haven't gone away. In the short term, the debate will be how to handle a surplus. It's often the most contentious.''

Back when things were simple -- when the Twin Donuts sold doughnuts and the Kennedy Fried Chicken next door sold fried chicken -- all was peaceful, city officials said. The stores shared a common roof and a common wall, at 876 Hunts Point Avenue in the Bronx, but had different doors, different rents and a different customer base.
Then, a few weeks ago, the owner of the Twin Donuts sold the store to a new entrepreneur. The new owner introduced new items to his menu, including steak sandwiches, mozzarella sticks and fried chicken, according to Robert Pinto, a New York City fire marshal.

Then, a few weeks ago, the owner of the Twin Donuts sold the store to a new entrepreneur. The new owner introduced new items to his menu, including steak sandwiches, mozzarella sticks and fried chicken, according to Robert Pinto, a New York City fire marshal.
''The chicken guy was mad at the doughnut guy because the doughnut guy started selling fried chicken, and the doughnut guy was undercutting the chicken guy's prices by 50 cents a plate,'' Mr. Pinto said. ''The chicken guy was losing a lot of business and he had gotten some violations from the Health Department. So he was going to plan on shutting his business down and renovating to correct the health code violations. At the same time he was feuding with the doughnut guy, telling the doughnut guy not to sell the chicken.''
So after closing time on Sunday, the fire marshal said, the owner of Kennedy Fried Chicken decided to send a clear message to his chicken competitor. He punched a hole in the wall between the two stores with a hammer, Mr. Pinto said.
Then, he sprayed gasoline that he had put in a 32-ounce fruit juice container through the hole and ignited it with a match, Mr. Pinto said. The Kennedy Fried Chicken owner then closed his store and left, he said.
Firefighters arrived shortly after 4 a.m. on Monday to a two-alarm fire. The flames had destroyed the doughnut shop and damaged part of the fried chicken store, Mr. Pinto said.
But when the owner of the fried chicken shop showed up at the scene, he did not seem distraught, which aroused suspicions, Mr. Pinto said.
Another fire marshal discovered the hole in the wall, which matched a hammer they also found in the wreckage, Mr. Pinto said.
When questioned, the owner of the Kennedy Fried Chicken, Kabeer Ahmad, told the authorities about the rivalry and confessed that he had set the fire, Mr. Pinto said. Mr. Ahmad, 32, was arrested and charged with arson.

Mrs. Clinton's name was printed in the inaugural program, however, and a number of New Yorkers at the ceremony said they were surprised when the M.C. greeted Senator Charles E. Schumer and Representative Charles B. Rangel by name -- as well as ''the entire Congressional delegation'' -- but made no mention of Senator Clinton.
New York's power brokers do not frequently assemble in the same place at the same time, unless it's to mark a funeral or tragedy. Seated among one another were the new governor and three former ones, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Senator Schumer, the various members of Congress, City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn, a number of legislators, and a lot of lobbyists.
Senator Clinton and Mr. Spitzer have a good working relationship, the governor's advisers said, and they sat down with him for a long brunch last month to discuss her possible presidential campaign. Advisers to Senator Clinton did not return phone calls about her private schedule yesterday.

The sky was pitch black and a steady rain was falling when Mr. Spitzer arrived in Washington Park at 5:43 a.m. yesterday to keep his first campaign promise: taking a morning run through the park on his first day in office.
''I have one simple question: Whose idea was this?'' Mr. Spitzer joked after he entered the lake house to cheers from friends, supporters and local residents. He marveled that old friends from college -- ''People who would never have been up this early'' -- had managed to rouse themselves from bed in the wee hours of New Year's Day.

Leading a pack of more than 100 runners -- dozens of them wearing blue T-shirts with the slogan ''Day One Everything Is Changing'' -- Mr. Spitzer wound his way west along the lake; up a hill toward State Street, one of the city's most elegant and historic thoroughfares; past the Soldiers and Sailors Monument; and along a bridle path back to the lake house. The route was just short of two miles.
The new governor ran in the New York City Marathon in 1983, finishing just under four hours. He said he went to bed at 1:30 a.m. yesterday after being officially sworn in and woke up when ''the internal clock started kicking in about 4:30, because I thought I'd be late'' for the run.

Shortly before 1 p.m. yesterday, George Arzt, a media consultant and lobbyist based in New York City, stood on the grass in West Capitol Park, waiting for the inauguration ceremony to begin.
''It's our turn,'' he said, meaning the Democrats, as he gazed contentedly at one of the large video screens nearby. ''Can you feel it?''
Shortly before 1 p.m. yesterday, George Arzt, a media consultant and lobbyist based in New York City, stood on the grass in West Capitol Park, waiting for the inauguration ceremony to begin.
''It's our turn,'' he said, meaning the Democrats, as he gazed contentedly at one of the large video screens nearby. ''Can you feel it?''
For Mr. Arzt, as for others, the arrival of a new Democratic governor was a pleasant occasion for several reasons. It was good, he said, to see so many friends and acquaintances in the crowd. It was good to see a Democrat back in the governor's office after 12 years of Republican rule, he said. And it was also good that the Democrat in question is an old client and comrade: Mr. Arzt was a media consultant for Mr. Spitzer's successful 1998 run for the attorney general's office.
''Obviously, I'll have access here when I need it,'' he said. ''But clearly it's fantastic to have someone in office who is so confident and innovative.''
As Mr. Spitzer spoke about the urgent need to reform state government, Mr. Arzt looked on with something like familial pride. He glanced around the crowd, recognizing familiar faces, picking out new ones. ''Lots of city people here,'' Mr. Arzt pronounced. ''Everyone wants to get reacquainted. A lot of people are just happy to see their friends.''
A few minutes after Mr. Spitzer's address, Mr. Arzt ran into another old acquaintance -- Jeffrey S. Wiesenfeld, a former aide to George E. Pataki.
''You think the next governor will give the same speech?'' Mr. Wiesenfeld asked, imagining Mr. Spitzer's eventual departure.
''Maybe, if he's from a different party,'' Mr. Arzt responded.
''I don't know,'' said Mr. Wiesenfeld, who recalled Mr. Pataki's first inauguration speech, also heavy on calls for change. ''It sounded awfully familiar to me.''

Cyndy Hall began volunteering for Democratic campaigns in 1968, making phone calls on behalf of Eugene J. McCarthy, but she never felt as politically satisfied, she said yesterday, as she did with the election and inauguration of Mr. Spitzer.
''This was the campaign that made you jump out of bed and want to get to work,'' said Ms. Hall, a retired music teacher who is active in Democratic politics in Claverack, N.Y. ''I have never, in all these decades, seen a candidate with integrity like Spitzer's, or the ability to fight all the big guys for all of us little guys.''

''I have never, in all these decades, seen a candidate with integrity like Spitzer's, or the ability to fight all the big guys for all of us little guys.''
After eight years of prosecuting white-collar fraud at powerful corporations, Mr. Spitzer has won a following among die-hard liberal and economic progressives like Ms. Hall, just as there are plenty of industry leaders who loathe his aggressive legal tactics. And the die-hards came out in strong numbers to attend the free inaugural ceremony yesterday.
Some of the most enthusiastic Spitzerites (or Spitzans, or Spitzeristas) tried in vain to get last-minute tickets for Mr. Spitzer's receiving line at the governor's mansion, which was eventually limited to 1,200 people, most of whom had requested tickets in advance. Those who got in were delighted to see Spitzer family photographs on the mantel and shelves, and posters showing swearing-in ceremonies through the ages -- for governors like Franklin D. Roosevelt, Hugh L. Carey and (just after midnight) Mr. Spitzer.
''They also had on display New York's original copy of the U.S. Constitution,'' said Mary Lou Darling of Niskayuna, N.Y. ''And Mr. And Mrs. Spitzer were so cordial, even though they must've been exhausted. It made you proud to be a New Yorker.''

Everyone knows that the judges on the Court of Appeals wear black robes. But who knew that they have matching bright orange scarves for outdoor occasions? It turns out that the matching orange neckwear was distributed by the court's chief judge, Judith S. Kaye, who took a liking to the scarves when she attended Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's second inauguration in New York City last year.
The mayor's staff had given the orange scarves to volunteers at the ceremony, according to a Bloomberg aide. Former Mayor Edward I. Koch liked them so much that he asked a volunteer for one. Judge Kaye did the same. And several weeks ago, Judge Kaye contacted Patricia E. Harris, the first deputy mayor, and asked if the city had any left. City officials found other scarves and sent them to Albany for use by the other judges.

Fermina Nunez's life, dreams and death all revolved around her love of hair. Even as a young girl in the Dominican Republic, she worked as a stylist at her aunt's salon, her family said. Without any formal training, they said, she intuitively did a delicate, elaborate dance with scissors, combs and blow dryers.
Styling led her to opportunities in the Bronx; Providence, R.I.; and Middletown, N.Y. The last place was where she finally opened up her own salon, Final Cuts by Fermina, and she hoped she would be able to buy her first house for her and her four sons.

Styling led her to opportunities in the Bronx; Providence, R.I.; and Middletown, N.Y. The last place was where she finally opened up her own salon, Final Cuts by Fermina, and she hoped she would be able to buy her first house for her and her four sons.
Her love for her job was such, her family said, that she often stayed at her salon well past its official closing time. That happened on Saturday night, the police said, when she stayed past the normal 10 p.m. closing to help three clients primp for New Year's Eve.
About 11:55, a man walked into the salon, at 133 Wickham Avenue in Middletown, and told Ms. Nunez and her three customers to lie face down on the floor, said Gregory Metakes, a spokesman for the Middletown Police Department. The man asked Ms. Nunez how to open the cash register. When he couldn't, he became angry, walked over to her with a small-caliber handgun, and shot her once in the back of the head, according to witness accounts given to the police.
The man, said to be about 5 feet 6 inches tall, more than 200 pounds, and wearing a black hood and a Yankees cap, fled, but it was unclear if he left on foot or in a vehicle, the police said.
Late last night, officers from Middletown and the state police took a man in the Bronx River section of the Bronx into custody in connection with the killing, and moved him to Middletown for questioning. Domonic Simone, 49, who lives on the street where the man was taken into custody, said that about 9 p.m., ''I heard two shots and at first I thought they were fireworks because last night there were fireworks.''
Ms. Nunez's death, in addition to devastating her four sons -- Anthony, 18; Michael, 16; Chris, 15; and Brian, 13 -- five brothers and sisters, and 21 nieces and nephews, has also stunned her loyal customers, many of whom showed up last night bearing cards, flowers and votive candles that they placed outside her salon.
Charnell Tootle, 29, said she liked to get her hair done by Ms. Nunez since she was the only one in town who could do a doobie the way she liked it -- a style in which the hair is set in rollers and then blown out to cover the face.
''Fermina was the only one who knew this particular hairstyle,'' said Ms. Tootle, who dropped off a heart-shaped balloon last night. She said she had started taking her two young daughters to the salon.
''Her shop felt comfortable and homey,'' Ms. Tootle said.
Ms. Nunez, who was 36, loved Middletown and lobbied her siblings to move there. It was quieter and safer than in the Bronx, she argued.
Two of her siblings had moved there and a third planned to do so this year.
''She wanted to get us away from the crime, and the crime came to us,'' said Juan Nunez, 37, one of her brothers who lives in Middletown. The family said last night that they would keep the salon open. They say they know she would have wanted it that way.

99 <html><head><b><center>Cornerback For Broncos Is Killed In Shooting<center></b></head><p align="left">Denver Broncos cornerback Darrent Williams is shot and killed by unknown assailant while riding in his limousine in Denver (Colo); photos (M)
About a month ago, the Denver Broncos starting cornerback Darrent Williams said he looked forward to returning to Fort Worth during the off-season to warn young people in his hometown about staying away from violence and drugs.
Williams never made it home. Early yesterday, hours after the Broncos were denied a berth in the N.F.L. playoffs by losing in overtime to the San Francisco 49ers, he was shot to death in downtown Denver when the limousine he was riding in was fired on from another vehicle, the police said. They declined to comment on whether any suspects were being questioned. Williams was 24.
Darrent Williams was shot dead a few blocks from a nightclub where a group that included the Broncos cornerback had been in a dispute with another group, according to a police spokesman.
About a month ago, the Denver Broncos starting cornerback Darrent Williams said he looked forward to returning to Fort Worth during the off-season to warn young people in his hometown about staying away from violence and drugs.
Williams never made it home. Early yesterday, hours after the Broncos were denied a berth in the N.F.L. playoffs by losing in overtime to the San Francisco 49ers, he was shot to death in downtown Denver when the limousine he was riding in was fired on from another vehicle, the police said. They declined to comment on whether any suspects were being questioned. Williams was 24.
The shooting occurred a few blocks from a nightclub where a group that included Williams had been in a dispute with another group, according to a police spokesman, Sonny Jackson. He said that Williams was not directly involved in the dispute and that it was not a physical confrontation.
A man and a woman who were in the limousine with Williams were also shot; Jackson said their injuries were not serious.
Kenyon Martin, the injured star forward of the N.B.A.'s Denver Nuggets, told The Denver Post that Williams was among Broncos and Nuggets players at the club to celebrate New Year's Eve and also Martin's birthday. Martin said that he and several other Nuggets players left before midnight and that there had been no trouble at the club to that point.
Mark Warkentien, the Nuggets' vice president for basketball operations, told The Associated Press that the police spoke with him but asked him not to comment.
Williams, a second-year pro out of Oklahoma State, was riding in a stretch Hummer when the gunfire erupted just after 2 a.m., hitting three people in the limousine, according to the police.
Williams's agent, Jeff Griffin, told The Post that Williams was shot in the neck. He was pronounced dead at Denver Health Medical Center shortly after 2:30 a.m. An unidentified man, who the police said was not a Broncos player, was treated at a hospital and released. A woman who was shot, also unidentified, remained hospitalized but was expected to be released in a few days.
Jackson would not identify others in the limousine. Several Denver-area news outlets reported that Broncos wide receiver Javon Walker was among them.
As many as a dozen bullet holes were visible in the limousine, which veered into a snowbank, and one window was blown out. The police said they believed the shots came from a large white sport-utility vehicle with dark-tinted windows that pulled alongside the limousine.
''We don't believe that it's random,'' Jackson said.
Jackson said that the police did not believe any shots were fired from the limousine and that they found no weapons inside it.
Williams, a right cornerback, had 86 tackles, 3 recovered fumbles and 4 interceptions this season, teaming with Champ Bailey for an outstanding cornerback tandem. Williams was the third N.F.L. player to be shot in the past six months.
The last active N.F.L. player to die was San Francisco's Thomas Herrion, who had a heart attack after an exhibition game in 2005. In July 2000, running back Fred Lane, the Carolina Panthers' career-leading rusher before his trade to the Indianapolis Colts two months earlier, was fatally shot at his home by his wife, who later pleaded guilty to manslaughter.
Downtown Denver, its streets surrounded by mounds of plowed snow from recent storms, was largely quiet yesterday, but fans trickled to the site where Williams was shot. ''My heart doesn't break very easy, but when I got up and heard the news today, my heart fell and broke,'' said Cory Anderson, 25, who delivers medical supplies.
The Broncos players were off yesterday, but about 20 gathered at team headquarters to console one another, according to The Associated Press. Players will return to their headquarters today to clean out their lockers and begin the off-season.
''All of us are devastated by this tragedy,'' the Broncos' owner, Pat Bowlen, said in a statement. ''To lose a young player, and more important, a great young man such as Darrent Williams, is incomprehensible. To lose him in such a senseless manner as this is beyond words.''
Williams was an only child reared by his mother in a tough neighborhood in Fort Worth. In an interview with The Denver Post published Dec. 3, Williams said that from the time he was 8, he told people he would play in the N.F.L. But as a teenager, he said, he associated with the wrong people, including gang members. While in high school, he skipped classes so often that his coaches -- he was a three-sport star -- drove around looking for him.
''I was running the streets, getting into trouble,'' Williams said. ''I was going down the wrong way for a while.''
But Williams said he began to change after hearing a preacher encourage parishioners to pray more. He went to Oklahoma State in part because it was closer to home than some of the other colleges that pursued him.
He was the Broncos' second-round draft pick in 2005 and was starting by the third game of his rookie season. He bought his mother a new house and a car, and he was about to release a CD under his own label with rap and rhythm-and-blues by artists from his old neighborhood, he told The Post.
Williams, who was not married, had a son and a daughter who live with their mother in Texas. In the interview, Williams said he and his children's mother got along well.
He said, ''I feel like I've got a better deal than a lot of people.''

Rowdy Students Are Taking Over<center></b></head><p align="left">Library in Maplewood, NJ, decides to close for several hours every weekday afternoon, citing rowdy behavior by middle-school students; library officials say they have been calling police, sometimes twice daily, as students have fights, scrawl graffiti on walls, talk back to librarians or refuse to leave when asked; say one threatened to burn down library; Maplewood's library officials, like many across country, have grown frustrated by middle schoolers' mix of pent-up energy, hormones and nascent independence; libraries in other parts of country have banned children under 14 unless accompanied by adult, suspended library privileges for repeat offenders and many libraries are adding security guards specifically for after-school hours; librarians and other experts say growing conflicts are result of increase in number of latchkey children, decrease in civility among young people and dearth of 'third places'--neither home nor school--where kids can be kids; photo (M)
Every afternoon at Maplewood Middle School's final bell, dozens of students pour across Baker Street to the public library. Some study quietly.
Others, library officials say, fight, urinate on the bathroom floor, scrawl graffiti on the walls, talk back to librarians or refuse to leave when asked. One recently threatened to burn down the branch library. Librarians call the police, sometimes twice a day.
In New Jersey, one library has grown frustrated by middle schoolers’ mix of pent-up energy, hormones and nascent independence.
Every afternoon at Maplewood Middle School's final bell, dozens of students pour across Baker Street to the public library. Some study quietly.
Others, library officials say, fight, urinate on the bathroom floor, scrawl graffiti on the walls, talk back to librarians or refuse to leave when asked. One recently threatened to burn down the branch library. Librarians call the police, sometimes twice a day.
As a result, starting on Jan. 16, the Maplewood Memorial Library will be closing its two buildings on weekdays from 2:45 to 5 p.m., until further notice.
An institution that, like many nationwide, strives to attract young people, even offering beading and cartooning classes, will soon be shutting them out, along with the rest of the public, at one of the busiest parts of its day.
Library employees will still be on the job, working at tasks like paperwork, filing, and answering calls and online questions.
''They almost knocked me down, and they run in and out,'' said Lila Silverman, a Maplewood resident who takes her grandchildren to the library's children's room but called the front of the library ''a disaster area'' after school. ''I do try to avoid those hours.''
This comfortable Essex County suburb of 23,000 residents, still proud of its 2002 mention in Money magazine on a list of ''Best Places to Live,'' is no seedy outpost of urban violence. But its library officials, like many across the country, have grown frustrated by middle schoolers' mix of pent-up energy, hormones and nascent independence.
Increasingly, librarians are asking: What part of ''Shh!'' don't you understand?
About a year ago, the Wickliffe, Ohio, library banned children under 14 during after-school hours unless they were accompanied by adults. An Illinois library adopted a ''three strikes, you're out'' rule, suspending library privileges for repeat offenders. And many libraries are adding security guards specifically for the after-school hours.
In Euclid, Ohio, the library pumps classical music into its lobby, bathrooms and front entry to calm patrons, including those from the nearby high school.
A backlash against such measures has also begun: A middle school in Jefferson Parish, La., that requires a daily permission slip for students to use the local public library after school was threatened with a lawsuit last month by the American Civil Liberties Union.
Librarians and other experts say the growing conflicts are the result of an increase in the number of latchkey children, a decrease in civility among young people and a dearth of ''third places'' -- neither home nor school -- where kids can be kids.
''We don't consider the world as safe a place as it used to be, and we don't encourage children to run around, hang around and be free,'' said Judy Nelson, president of the Young Adult Library Services Association, part of the American Library Association. ''So you have parents telling their kids that the library is a good place to go.''
Rowland Bennett, who served as the director of the Maplewood Memorial Library for 30 years and is now president of the local school board, said libraries had become ''the child care center by necessity.''
Linda W. Braun, a librarian and professor who has written four books about teenagers' use of libraries, said the students want only to be treated like everybody else.
''If there are little kids making noise, it's cute, and they can run around, it's O.K.,'' Ms. Braun said of standard library operating procedure. ''Or if seniors with hearing difficulties are talking loudly, that's accepted. But a teen who might talk loudly for a minute or two gets in trouble.''
She added: ''The parents don't want them, the library doesn't want them, so they act out.''
That leaves librarians doing a job they did not sign up for: baby-sitting for kids old enough to baby-sit.
The Maplewood library has created a gallery space for young people's artwork, put on an anime film festival and formed a Teen Advisory Group that attracted 30 youngsters for a recent pizza party.
But problems persisted.
In consultation with a lawyer, the library board came up with behavior guidelines in May 2005 that prohibited activities like ''hairdressing or grooming of another person'' and ''refusal to leave the building.'' The policy includes some politely precise language common to those who speak softly from behind a reference desk: ''If a patron seems to be placing a staff member in the position of providing a nonlibrary-related function, the staff member may bring the interaction to a prompt conclusion.''
But library officials felt that a bigger stick was needed. Last week, the board posted a notice on its Web site and library doors saying it had ''struggled with this problem for over 10 years'' and voted ''with great reluctance'' on Dec. 20 to close after school.
''Having as many as 50 young people with nothing to do creates an untenable situation,'' read the note, which pointed out that many students did not use library resources but simply socialized in the building. ''It interferes with patrons of all ages who want to use the library and with the staff members who are there to serve them. The library can no longer deal with large numbers of students who come after school and wait, sometimes into the late evening, to be picked up.''
The decision has not been popular in town. In a posting on Maplewoodonline.com, the community's Internet bulletin board, one resident, Joan Crystal, said an alternative needed to be developed before closing the library. ''I also think it improper to close the library during hours when adults, older students and M.M.S. students find it most convenient to use the library,'' she wrote.
David Huemer, who represents the Maplewood Township Committee on the library board, said he would like to see the current police station, which is being retired in favor of a new one, converted to a youth center.
''What we have to do now is build some long-overdue facilities and fund some programs so kids can have alternatives to hanging out,'' he said. ''To the extent that the vote of the library board is going to wake people up and get them to do something about kids from sixth grade to high school, that's a good thing.''
About eight years ago, the library in nearby Irvington, N.J., struggling with similar problems, was shuttered for an hour each afternoon. But it was only for three days, until the students managed to settle down, officials said.
Veronica Morton, who was returning a Magic School Bus book to the Maplewood library the other day with her 8-year-old daughter, Alexandra, said she had become a ''shush mommy'' after watching librarians struggle to ''get kids to calm down.''
Outside the library, students who use it gave the new hours two thumbs down, way down.
''Kids will get into real mischievous activities'' with the library closed, warned one teenager, Jonathan Brock, a student at the district's alternative high school program.
''I'm kind of annoyed,'' said David Carliner, a middle schooler who was rushing up the library steps ahead of his father. ''It closes right when my school gets out, so I can't check out any books.''

102 <html><head><b><center>Not the Case<center></b></head><p align="left">Even among those who opposed the Iraq war from the start, there was always hope that bringing Saddam Hussein to justice would be a saving grace of the entire misbegotten enterprise. Now it seems that even this comfort will be denied. Far from healing old wounds, as some suggested it would, his conviction by the Iraqi special tribunal has exerted little effect on the deepening civil conflict between Shiites and Sunnis. The often circuslike atmosphere of the trial, as well as the murder of three defense lawyers, led groups like Human Rights Watch to condemn the tribunal as flawed and illegitimate. And the charge for which Saddam Hussein received the death penalty did not include his most heinous acts. His execution must still remind the world of the horror of the atrocities he committed while in power. But unfortunately, the disarray of the legal process calls greater attention to the failings of the United States, the Iraqis and the international community in dealing with all that has come after.
Since its inception, the tribunal has been haunted by a fundamental problem that bedevils the new Iraqi government more generally: the nature and origin of its authority. That the Iraqi dictator deserved to be punished was never in question. But from what source did the tribunal, which was established under U.S. occupation and then affirmed by the sovereign Iraqi government, derive the right to do so? This was not an academic question. Saddam Hussein was found guilty and sentenced to hang for sending 148 men and boys to their deaths in the aftermath of an attempted assassination against him in the Shiite town of Dujail in 1982. Under Iraqi law at the time, the president was immune from prosecution. In order to satisfy the rule of law - and to avoid the appearance of victor's justice - the tribunal needed to be able to explain its basis for applying the law that was used to find him guilty.

In order to satisfy the rule of law - and to avoid the appearance of victor's justice - the tribunal needed to be able to explain its basis for applying the law that was used to find him guilty.
In part, the tribunal sought to draw legitimacy from international law. The court found Saddam Hussein guilty not of ordinary murder but of ''crimes against humanity,'' a grand-sounding, internationally recognized charge with intuitive moral force. When the phrase ''crimes against humanity'' was used at the Nuremberg trials in 1945, the convening nations did not bother to explain what gave them the right to define and punish such crimes. It was presumed self-evident that certain actions were so terrible that they must be treated as illegal, even if they might have been permissible under Nazi German law when they took place. The so-called Rome Statute, which created the International Criminal Court in The Hague in 2002, specifically defined crimes against humanity in terms drawn from the Nuremberg charter, and the definition used by the Iraqi special tribunal was copied from there.
Yet it is hard to believe that the Iraqi tribunal could convincingly claim its authority from the international community. Like the United States, Iraq has not ratified the Rome Statute. Indeed, the Iraqi tribunal explicitly avoided submitting itself to international standards so that it would be able to apply the death penalty, which most of the international community rejects. This resulted in near complete withdrawal of international cooperation in the investigation of Saddam Hussein's crimes and the trial itself, and the tribunal lost some of the perception of fairness that would have come from broader international participation.
So where, if anywhere, did the Iraqi tribunal get the right to punish Saddam Hussein for crimes against humanity? Sovereign nations like Iraq can, of course, punish whatever crimes they choose, and can change or abrogate their own earlier laws to do it. But there is something unsatisfying about offering this as an account, for it diminishes the tribunal's credible claim that the Iraqi dictator's actions reverberated worldwide, implicating not just Iraq but all of humanity. There must be some deeper source of law, apart from treaties or the dictates of the United Nations Security Council, that bans the systematic killing of innocents.
The most persuasive answer is that a law prohibiting crimes against humanity derives its authority from the inherent moral responsibility that lies with whoever has the capacity to punish truly heinous deeds. To be sure, in some cases the international community will bear that responsibility. In the case of Iraq, though, the international community was not in a position to act, not only because of the question of the death penalty but also because many of its members denied the legality of the invasion. Responsibility rested with the powers that actually held Saddam Hussein within their grasp. Their right - and their duty - was to bring him to justice.
By these lights, the decision to charge Saddam Hussein with crimes against humanity was morally and legally justified. Nevertheless, the process fell short of what is needed to invoke the transcendent norms of universal justice. This was a profound failure. As with the other shortcomings of Iraq's government, many players were at fault here: the Americans for failing to provide security for the Iraqis, including the defense team; the Iraqis for failing to get the trial - or the country - to run smoothly; the international community for sanctimoniously disengaging.
But the fact that blame is to be shared does not mitigate the tragedy of this missed opportunity.

When I heard about this concoction last week and wondered how Champagne bubbles would fare in the milkiness, I couldn't just go to my local liquor store and buy absinthe. I had to substitute one of the anise-flavored alcohols that took absinthe's place when it was banned in France and in the United States about a century ago.
While absinthe is still banned in this country, it is easy to buy over the Internet: Its reputation, however, remains as cloudy as the cocktails that are made with it.
READERS of Ernest Hemingway know ''Death in the Afternoon'' as a book about bullfighting. But to drinkers with a taste for obscure booze, it is also a cocktail that Hemingway contributed to a 1935 collection of celebrity recipes. His directions: ''Pour one jigger absinthe into a Champagne glass. Add iced Champagne until it attains the proper opalescent milkiness. Drink three to five of these slowly.''
When I heard about this concoction last week and wondered how Champagne bubbles would fare in the milkiness, I couldn't just go to my local liquor store and buy absinthe. I had to substitute one of the anise-flavored alcohols that took absinthe's place when it was banned in France and in the United States about a century ago.
Today absinthe is legal again throughout Europe, and while it is still banned in this country, it is easy to buy over the Internet. Its reputation, however, remains as cloudy as the cocktails that are made with it. Some welcome clarification has now arrived in the form of a new study by a team of German chemists and physicians.
Absinthe is a distilled spirit flavored with a variety of herbs and spices, primarily wormwood, an aromatic, bitter shrub. The key constituent of wormwood is a chemical called thujone, which gives it -- and absinthe -- a penetrating evergreen aroma. (Thujone is also a major component of the herb sage.) Thujone and the other aromatic compounds are what cause absinthe to become milky when it's diluted. The aromatics are more soluble in alcohol than in water, so when the concentrated spirit is cut with wine or water, they cluster together in tiny droplets that reflect light from their surfaces. Instantly, what was a clear liquid clouds over.
Absinthe became tremendously popular throughout Europe in the 19th century. It was blamed for causing hallucinations, mental instability and criminal behavior, which medical authorities attributed to thujone. This belief helped get absinthe banned. But according to the new study, by Dirk W. Lachenmeier and colleagues, the modern medical consensus is that absinthism was either simple alcohol poisoning -- some absinthes were 70 percent alcohol, nearly double the strength of most distilled drinks -- or caused by methanol and other toxic adulterants found in some cheap absinthes.
Thujone is true to its reputation in one respect: it does turn out to have unusual pharmacological properties. It interacts with several neurotransmitter systems in the brain, including one that is also activated by the cannabinoids in marijuana. But while absinthe will get you drunk, it won't make you stoned. In one experiment, a dose of thujone equivalent to a pint of absinthe lowered the subjects' performance on attention tests and made them more anxious. Very large doses are toxic, but moderate consumption appears to be safe.
But buyer beware: Europe currently has no regulations on how absinthe is made or what it can be made from. The German chemists think some rules are a good idea: some Czech brands they sampled were tinted turquoise, were flavored with mint instead of wormwood, tasted sweet instead of bitter and were so dilute that they didn't grow cloudy when mixed with water.
Which brings me back to my Death in the Afternoon cocktail. When I poured the Champagne into my absinthe substitute, Pernod, a good milkiness developed, but after the initial whoosh there were only a couple of lonely bubble clusters on the surface, slowly and invisibly replenished from the murky depths. I felt only a slight prickle on the tongue. It seemed a waste of effervescence, especially after what I've been learning from the world expert on the subject.
Gérard Liger-Belair is a physicist at the University of Reims, where he trains a high-speed digital camera through a microscope onto glasses of wine from local cellars. His 2004 book, ''Uncorked: The Science of Champagne,'' revealed that most Champagne bubbles arise from something you might be tempted to scour from your flutes: dust.
Kitchen towels and the ambient air deposit tiny hollow cellulose fibers from cotton, paper and other plant products on the surface of a clean glass. The air pockets in those hollow fibers allow dissolved carbon dioxide molecules in the wine to collect and pop off in a bubble, which leaves a remnant behind to start the process all over again. As they rise in the glass, the bubbles gather more carbon dioxide, so they expand and accelerate. When they burst at the surface, they shoot tiny jets of liquid as much as an inch into the air, tickling the nose and delivering aroma.
In more recent work Professor Liger-Belair has shown just how lucky we are in the quality of our plant dust. It turns out that the cellulose fiber hollows are of just the right size -- about a tenth the diameter of a human hair -- to produce small, regularly spaced bubbles that keep coming for a long time. If they were much narrower, then the bubbles would be released faster and closer together, and the gas would be exhausted from the glass much sooner. If the fiber interior were as wide as a hair, then the bubbles would be more coarse, and we wouldn't get as many of them.
Because the fibers and the gas pockets are scattered across the glass surface, each bubble train rises in undisturbed isolation. The result is a clockwork release of bubbles, evenly spaced and pleasing to the eye.
Champagne flutes are sometimes scratched or engraved to encourage more predictable bubbling, but the research shows that this produces a microscopic trench in which gas pockets grow into one another and coalesce, so the bubble size and release are irregular and chaotic. Help may be on the way, though. ''We are working hard with glassmakers to produce artificial nucleation sites with the same properties as cellulose fibers,'' Professor Liger-Belair wrote in an e-mail message. ''This is a nice little challenge for nanotechnology!''
Another challenge: With all Professor Liger-Belair has discovered about the birth and life of Champagne bubbles, is there a way to make ''Death in the Afternoon'' a bit more lively?

THE lineup of wines to be served with dinner was extraordinary, including a Montrachet from 1939 and a Volnay Caillerets from 1929. Still, the wine I couldn't wait to try was the '46 Meursault Charmes.
That would be the 1846.
When it comes to vintage wines, what’s in the bottle almost matters less than the vivid historical images conjured up by the year on the label.
THE lineup of wines to be served with dinner was extraordinary, including a Montrachet from 1939 and a Volnay Caillerets from 1929. Still, the wine I couldn't wait to try was the '46 Meursault Charmes.
That would be the 1846.
The dinner was in honor of Bouchard Père & Fils, the venerable Burgundy producer and négociant, which was celebrating its 275th anniversary with a tasting of some very, very old wines. It was held at the historic Château de Beaune, a 15th-century fortress here that has been the producer's ceremonial and corporate home since 1810. In addition to the 1846, Bouchard was to pour a relative youngster, the 1865 Beaune Grèves Vigne de L'Enfant Jésus.
Both of these ancient vintages had spent their long lives in the bowels of the chateau, where thick walls keep the cellars cool and the bottles can rest undisturbed. As rare as it is to taste wines this old, it's even more unusual to taste bottles with such an unimpeachable provenance.
Scientists know that the gradual interaction between a fine wine and small amounts of oxygen results in what we call aging. Firm tannins soften and aggressive aromas of fruit mellow and evolve into complex new characteristics. A wine becomes harmonious and shows new dimensions.
That's the ideal, anyway. How the wine is stored and handled and a host of other factors can be the difference between a sublime old bottle and an expired soup. What no one has been able to do is predict when a wine will be at its peak or exactly how it will fare in its descent. What happens after a few decades along the aging trail is a mystery. But wine as old as these bottles borders on the mystical.
''No producer makes a wine to be drunk after 80 years,'' said François Audouze, a retired French steel executive who now arranges dinners centered on old wines and who was at this dinner. ''When a wine is older than that, it is generally not the result of a will but of an accident.''
The evening had begun in a nondescript industrial area outside this handsome little city, which has been the center of the Burgundy wine trade for 300 years or more. First, we toured Bouchard's new winery with its great steel tanks, catwalks, lots of oak barrels, the smell of fermented grape juice, even -- gasp -- a bottling apparatus. Then there was a tasting of Bouchard's 2005 lineup; 2005 was an excellent year in Burgundy, and Bouchard's wines are elegant and pure.
But the luminaries on the tour this soggy late fall evening -- including Clive Coates, the British writer; Serena Sutcliffe, the head of Sotheby's international wine department; Allen Meadows of burghound.com, a leading Burgundy critic; and the French writers Thierry Desseauve and Jacky Rigaux -- hadn't come to Bouchard to sample unreleased wines. So it was with a discernible eagerness that we dispatched the initial tasting and headed to the chateau. After a Champagne reception (magnums of 1988 Cuvée des Enchanteleurs from Henriot, a corporate sibling of Bouchard), the 49 guests trooped expectantly to the dining tables, where the six wines would accompany six courses.
What's in an ancient bottle almost matters less than the vivid historical images conjured up by the year on the label. An 1865? By the first hint of green on the vines that mid-April, Lincoln was dead, ''Hush'd Be the Camps Today,'' as Walt Whitman wrote that year.
The 1846? Not quite as resonant with me, although the French might have thought of Louis-Philippe, the last king to rule France, who was teetering on the throne before being unseated in 1848. The 1929 brought up the stock market crash and the start of the Great Depression, though I couldn't help thinking of my father, who was born in 1929 at the height of the summer.
Yet none of the wines summoned visions as searing as the 1939 Montrachet. As New Yorkers were enjoying their World's Fair, the French army had just been mobilized with France's entry into World War II. The harvest that fall stretched from days to weeks, Mr. Meadows recounted, as the women and children who were left behind picked grapes when they could, resulting in uneven degrees of ripeness.
Perhaps that explained why the '39 Montrachet, the second wine served after a well-balanced 1992 Chevalier-Montrachet, seemed so odd. It was a dark amber gold, with flavors of sherry and caramel, as if it were slightly oxidized. It smelled sweet yet tasted dry, and truthfully it was slightly disappointing. At first, at least. But an hour later, around the time I might have thought exposure to air would have dried out an older wine, the '39 Montrachet was just coming alive, with a beautiful, brilliant minerality. It was lesson No. 1 of this meal: never give up on a wine.
Lesson No. 2 came from Mr. Meadows, who has made it his business to taste wines from every vintage of the 20th century and before, if he can find them. ''Pay attention to the texture,'' he advised, alluding to the fact that the two 19th-century wines predated the phylloxera epidemic, which devastated European vineyards in the late 1800's. The 1846 and '65 would be those rare Burgundies grown on their own rootstock instead of on grafted American roots, the only protection against phylloxera.
The moment of truth came. The 1846 was poured carefully but generously by the wine stewards, who had opened five bottles. The labels looked almost new, no surprise there. The humidity in a good wine cellar will rot paper, so wineries rarely label bottles until they are ready for shipping. The corks looked fresh, too. With its older bottles, Bouchard replaces the cork every 25 to 30 years, sacrificing one bottle to top off the others, which keeps air from aging the wine more rapidly.
What can one say about a wine 160 years old? It was amber, browner than the 1939, but with wonderfully fresh aromas of lime, grapefruit, chalk and earth, and the slightest overlay of caramel. In the mouth it was vibrant with acidity that was remarkable in a wine this old.
Tasting it blind, I would have guessed it to be 100 years younger -- no, make that 130 years younger. And Mr. Meadows was right about texture: this wine was alive and joyous, almost thrusting itself out of the glass. I thought of horse carts, canals and steam engines. Pas mal, as the French say -- not a bad little chardonnay. And it got even better over time. What was it served with? I seem to remember chicken in cream sauce. It didn't much matter.
Reds were next, beginning with an appetite-whetter, Le Corton 1990, young and dark with wild berry aromas. Then, with the lamb, the 1929 Volnay Caillerets, Ancienne Cuvée Carnot, was poured. The '29 and '90 vintages were both exceptional in Burgundy, and the '29 was almost as dark as the '90, yet with a sedate sweet fruit aroma balanced by minerals. With time in the glass it developed a smell of truffles.
Finally, the last wine of the evening was poured, the 1865 Beaune Grèves Vigne de L'Enfant Jésus, from a vineyard entirely owned by Bouchard. Like the 1846, it too had the lively texture of youth. Its color was still vibrant, pale ruby with touches of orange around the edges. The fruit was gentle yet striking, reminiscent of the 1929 and even the '90, like a family resemblance seen over generations.
Where I was simply dazzled by the 1846, the 1865 conjured up a feeling of respect and awe. We were tasting a legacy, transmitted long after its makers had died and conveying emotions that might have been inconceivable back then. At a moment like that, I had no doubt that winemaking can rise to the level of an art.
I thought of those bottles deep in the cellar. They had survived the Franco-Prussian War, World War I and World War II, when Bouchard had constructed false walls in the cellars to conceal their older bottles from the Nazis. This year, Bouchard will no doubt put away a few bottles of those promising 2005's. May their passage be somewhat easier.

Logan Fox can't quite pinpoint the moment when movies and television shows replaced books as the cultural topics people liked to talk about over dinner, at cocktail parties, at work. He does know that at Micawber Books, his 26-year-old independent bookstore here that is to close for good in March, his own employees prefer to come in every morning and gossip about ''Survivor'' or ''that fashion reality show'' whose title he can't quite place.
''It kills me,'' Mr. Fox, 53, said over coffee on Friday afternoon, shaking his head. ''The amount of time spent discussing culturally iconic shows has superseded anything in the way of books that I can detect. Discussing books is very much one on one. It just hurts me.''
Independent bookstores have been under siege for decades. Now the battle is reaching some of the last redoubts, like Micawber Books, a 26-year-old independent bookstore.
Logan Fox can't quite pinpoint the moment when movies and television shows replaced books as the cultural topics people liked to talk about over dinner, at cocktail parties, at work. He does know that at Micawber Books, his 26-year-old independent bookstore here that is to close for good in March, his own employees prefer to come in every morning and gossip about ''Survivor'' or ''that fashion reality show'' whose title he can't quite place.
''It kills me,'' Mr. Fox, 53, said over coffee on Friday afternoon, shaking his head. ''The amount of time spent discussing culturally iconic shows has superseded anything in the way of books that I can detect. Discussing books is very much one on one. It just hurts me.''
Mr. Fox is bracing himself for an emotionally wrenching few months. In December Micawber announced that it would close, after years of fighting not only the tyranny of other media but also the steady encroachment of big-box retail competitors and the Internet.
Independent bookstores, of course, have been under siege for nearly two decades by the megachains and the Web retailers, and have been steadily dropping away, one by one. Now, though, the battle is reaching some of the last redoubts.
Mr. Fox said that Micawber's first chain competitor, Encore Books, arrived in the mid-1990s, and his sales plummeted 25 percent, nearly putting him out of business. Soon after, Barnes & Noble and Borders came to town. And then there was Amazon.com.
But beyond those factors, Mr. Fox said, he blames a change in American culture, in the quickening pace of people's lives, in the shrinking willingness to linger. During the 1980s, in the store's early days, customers would come in and stay all afternoon, carefully inspecting the books that were packed tightly together, spine to spine.
No longer. ''The driving force of all of this is the acceleration of our culture,'' Mr. Fox said. ''The old days of browsing, the old days of a person coming in for three or four hours on a Saturday and slowly meandering, making a small pile of books, being very selective, coming away with six or seven gems they wanted, are pretty much over. If you go to the Strand or to Micawber Books today, it's a whole different gear, where society wants satisfaction and fulfillment now.''
The other crisis for independent booksellers, Mr. Fox said, is the current state of publishing. The job of building writers' reputations and nurturing them has fallen to agents, he said. Publishers are concerned only with the bottom line, he added, looking for the home run instead of the single.
And there is the question of quality. Though Micawber carries a few, Mr. Fox laments the rapid growth of the celebrity cookbook genre. Children's books, in particular, are driven by marketability instead of creativity, said Bobbie Fishman, the children's books buyer at Micawber. ''It's either pirates, wizards, one of a series, or written by Katie Couric,'' she said.
Independent bookstores across the country are suffocating, squeezed by Amazon.com and the chain bookstores that deliver deeper discounts and wider variety than independent shops. According to the American Booksellers Association, a trade group of independent bookstores, there are about 2,500 such stores in the United States, down from about 4,700 in 1993. And that is not counting those that sell only used books.
Micawber opened in 1981, when Princeton was an old-money kind of place, with independently owned shops lining Nassau Street, adjacent to the picturesque Princeton University campus. ''When we first came, every store on this street was a 15-, 20-year entrenched old-family business,'' Mr. Fox said.
Today that same thoroughfare is dominated by chain stores like Ann Taylor and Foot Locker. Micawber Books, with its purple walls and its alien name, which comes from Dickens' novel ''David Copperfield,'' is the one that sticks out now.
Half the store is devoted to secondhand books and other vintage publications, like a stack of Archie comics on the register. The other half is new books, a well-edited mix that includes fiction, history, children's books and the occasional concession to popular taste, like Rachael Ray's ''Express Lane Meals.'' (There are also stalwarts, evidenced by the back wall of shelves lined with Penguin Classics.)
Mr. Fox is proudly from the old school of bookselling. He says he has only been inside a Barnes & Noble store three times. (''I can't do it,'' he said, grimacing.)
In the mid-1990s, when the struggling Micawber took on Margaret Griffin as a partner, she insisted that Mr. Fox abandon his system of 3-by-5-inch index cards in boxes and become computerized. The new Sony Reader, a handheld device that stores dozens of titles electronically? Never tried it.
''I don't want to sound corny about it,'' Mr. Fox said. ''But there is something transformative about the book.''
Mr. Fox began as a bookseller in the '70s at the Strand Book Store in Manhattan, and moved to Princeton to open Micawber, then a store devoted entirely to secondhand books from his own personal library. His father, Joe Fox, was an editor at Random House, nurturing the careers of John Irving and Truman Capote. His childhood was sprinkled with the romantic stuff of traditional New York publishing, with swanky book parties attended by famous authors and writers for The Paris Review.
In her 1998 film, ''You've Got Mail,'' Nora Ephron used the name of his father, who, as it happens, was also a former boyfriend of hers. Joe Fox was the name she gave the character played by Tom Hanks, a chain bookstore owner who swiftly puts Meg Ryan and her tiny shop around the corner out of business.
Of course, in the Micawber story, Logan Fox is in the Meg Ryan role, the person who champions the mom-and-pop store and derides the corporate behemoth.
In Micawber's case, Mr. Fox said there was no imminent financial crisis, only the recognition that years from now, selling the business would be a far more difficult task.
''Ten years down the road, we couldn't imagine who would buy us at all,'' he said. After Micawber quietly put out the word that it was for sale, Princeton University offered to buy the building that houses the store for an undisclosed sum, and promised to bring in Labyrinth Books, a scholarly chain with stores in New Haven and Manhattan. All the architectural details incorporated into Micawber, Mr. Fox pointed out sadly, will be bulldozed. And he has no idea what he will do next.
Still, Mr. Fox said he was trying hard not to be cynical. ''I consider this a success story,'' he said. ''Our intention was to be a good townspeople store.''

Oprah Winfrey Opens Her South African School
Oprah Winfrey yesterday opened the $40 million school she built in South Africa to give disadvantaged girls a chance for a better future, The Associated Press reported. ''I wanted to give this opportunity to girls who had a light so bright that not even poverty could dim that light,'' Ms. Winfrey said at a news conference attended by Nelson Mandela, the former president of South Africa, and the entertainment celebrities Tina Turner, Mary J. Blige, Mariah Carey, Sidney Poitier, Chris Tucker and Spike Lee. Ms. Winfrey said she hoped the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls, above, in Henley-on-Klip, south of Johannesburg, could help ''change the face of a nation.'' She added, ''Girls who are educated are less likely to get H.I.V./AIDS, and in this country, which has such a pandemic, we have to begin to change the pandemic.'' Many of the girls come from afflicted families. Ms. Winfrey said that from 3,500 applicants, the academy, with a 28-building campus, accepted 152 girls ages 11 and 12. Eventually it will accommodate 450 and a broader age range. Ms. Winfrey said she planned a second school, for boys and girls, in the KwaZulu-Natal province.
Father Seeks News Of Boy From Madonna
The father of the motherless Malawian boy whom Madonna seeks to adopt wants news of his son, Reuters reported, citing a newspaper report. Madonna has custody of the boy. ''I don't have her phone and mailing address,'' the father, Yohane Banda, left, told The Daily Times, based in Blantyre, Malawi. ''All I want is to find out how my son is, but I don't know how I can do it. I only talked to her once at the High Court, and I want to talk to her now and find out about my child.'' Mr. Banda, the father of David Banda, 1, spoke to the newspaper after it presented him with $788 from a Scottish nun, Christine Webster, who told the paper she believed that the child would have been better off in Malawi. Mr. Banda dismissed suggestions that he was seeking the boy's return and asked human rights organizations that opposed the adoption to refrain from interfering with his attempts to talk with Madonna. ''All I want is to find out how my child is doing and not to have him back,'' he was quoted as saying. The adoption last year by Madonna, under an interim order, prompted questions about the use of celebrity to circumvent laws governing adoption of Malawians by foreigners.
'CSI' Creates New Crime Scene
''CSI'' is branching out of television and into museums across the country, Variety.com reported. The ''CSI'' show that makes its debut on May 25 won't be ''CSI: Chicago.'' It will be ''The 'CSI' Experience,'' and the showcase won't be CBS, but rather the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, where an interactive exhibition will instruct adults and older children in the joys of forensic science. Visitors will be able to gather evidence from fictional crime scenes and test it inside laboratories and autopsy rooms with the help of multimedia presentations and recorded video messages from stars of the three ''CSI'' programs on CBS. In September, after the exhibition spends the summer in Chicago, it will begin a national tour of science museums that could last as long as seven years. The exhibition is financed by the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, CBS Consumer Products and the National Science Foundation.
French Conductor For Vienna New Year
For the first time, a French conductor will usher in the New Year in Vienna, when Georges Prêtre leads the Vienna Philharmonic in the 2008 New Year's Day concert, Agence France-Presse reported. This year's concert was watched and heard by an audience of 50 million in 53 countries, organizers said. Televised by the Austrian station ORF, the concert saluted the entry of Bulgaria and Romania into the European Union with ''The Blue Danube'' by Johann Strauss the Younger. Mr. Prêtre, 82, is a former music director of the Paris Opera who has conducted most of the world's leading symphony orchestras.

But a new breed of Greek restaurants here also serves dishes like rabbit phyllo, grilled branzino with artichoke confit and dandelion greens, and Cretan honey-braised lamb shank with yogurt pasta.
Trend-setting chefs like Michael Psilakis at Onera, Christos Valtzoglou at Pylos and Michael Symon at Parea, to name a few, are giving Greek food new vibrancy. Thirty-four Greek restaurants are listed in the latest Zagat guide, 18 of them newcomers since 2000.

So I wondered, as I headed to Greece recently, whether I would encounter inventiveness at restaurants there, too.
As soon as a deconstructed version of a tomato stuffed with rice was placed before me at 48 Restaurant in Athens, I knew I need not have worried. The rice had been typically seasoned with tomato, cinnamon, pine nuts and currants but was shaped like ovals of sushi. Slabs of slow-roasted tomato topped them. That the chef, Christoforos Peskias, has Ferran Adrià as a mentor did not surprise me one bit.
As I traveled outside the big cities, I continued to be delighted by the fresh and new. In fact, as long as I stayed away from tourist places, I was in for an adventure.
But some of the most unusual yet simple and delicious food I found was in Rhodes, the large island not far from the coast of Turkey. This food was not obviously modern, but based on a sense of place and on the traditions and ingredients of the island. It's a rustic cuisine that New York restaurants have yet to discover.
I came home with recipes I could not wait to try. Most were from Mavrikos, a 70-year-old family restaurant in Lindos, a town in the southwestern corner of Rhodes known for its beaches and a steep acropolis reached by stairs or donkey. When Lindos was a jet-setting destination, before islands like Mykonos and Patmos were on the social radar screen, Mavrikos had a star-studded clientele. Nelson Rockefeller, members of Pink Floyd and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis stopped by, said Michalis Mavrikos, who runs the restaurant.
Most of the bold-face names have moved on, but Mr. Mavrikos and his brother, Dimitri, the chef, are maintaining the family's culinary traditions in the whitewashed dining room. Every evening, their father, Vassilis, 85, sits in one corner, near the small open kitchen, and casts a critical eye over everything.
For our party of six, Dimitri Mavrikos prepared a tasting menu of about 20 dishes.
(Tackling the recipes for some of them when I got home, I was happy to discover that even the most exotic-tasting dishes called for ingredients that are sold in American health food and Greek specialty stores, and also online.)
Gigantes, as huge, succulent butter beans are called, were simmered in a dark, musky sauce seasoned with carob. ''We can gather the carob pods from trees all around,'' Michalis Mavrikos said.
Fresh local red shrimp were peeled and pounded, raw, into a paste and seasoned with onion, garlic and orange, for a rich alternative to taramosalata. It's a dish I can try now, since fresh Maine shrimp are in season.
Freshly caught tuna loin was cured with sugar, salt and herbs, a little like gravlax, then sliced thin and served with pickled fennel. Gar, a long, skinny fish, was cooked and served in thick grape syrup, like saba, the Italian grape must. Poached skate was seasoned with herbs and pine nuts and formed into a timbale.
Meltingly tender beef had been slow-cooked in a casserole with cracked wheat and seasoned with bergamot, an aromatic citrus fruit that grows on the island and is best known as the flavoring for Earl Grey tea.
''You are probably thinking that some of these dishes, especially with the cracked wheat and exotic spices, came from Turkey,'' Michalis Mavrikos said. ''I assure you they do not.''
The seasonings for the tuna included fenugreek, a slightly pungent, grassy herb with seeds that can have a celery flavor. Although American cooks may associate it with Indian cooking, it grows wild on Rhodes, as does cumin, another seasoning used in some of the dishes.
If there is any non-Greek influence in the food at Mavrikos, it is likely to be French or Italian. When the Turks controlled Rhodes, the Mavrikos brothers' paternal grandfather moved to Marseilles, where he owned a bistro. When Italy took over Rhodes in 1912 he returned, married an Italian woman and opened the restaurant in 1933. His son, Vassilis, studied cooking in Athens before returning to cook in the family restaurant.
Dimitri Mavrikos said the cooking of his father and grandparents, along with the local traditions, are his most compelling influences.
''When I plan my menus I first try to find local things, vegetables from the villages, fish from nearby,'' he said. ''But local fresh fish are not as plentiful as they once were and it's getting harder to find them.''
The chef travels, often to London, when the restaurant is closed in winter.
''I'm always a little sad when I'm abroad,'' he said. ''I often can't find real Greek food and rarely are there any Greek wines.''
Perhaps he should plan a trip to New York, where he'll find Greek wines and respectable and inventive Greek food as well.
Slow-Cooked Beef with Cracked Wheat  Adapted from Mavrikos Restaurant, Rhodes, Greece  Time: 3 1/2 hours
2 1/2 pounds shin of beef, with bone, in 2-inch chunks
2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/2 cup finely chopped onion  1 clove garlic, minced  2 medium-size ripe tomatoes, finely chopped  1 teaspoon coriander seeds  2 bay leaves  4 whole allspice  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 cup dry white wine  3 tablespoons preserved bergamot (see note) 21/3 cups cracked wheat (not instant bulgur).
1.  Place beef in a pot with water to cover, bring to a boil and cook 5 minutes. Drain and dry meat.  2.  Heat oil in a heavy 4-quart casserole, add meat and lightly brown. Add onion, garlic, tomatoes, coriander seeds, bay leaves, allspice, salt and pepper and wine. Simmer for 30 minutes. Remove from heat and fold in bergamot and cracked wheat.  3.  Heat oven to 275 degrees. Transfer contents of casserole to a baking dish large enough to hold ingredients with room to spare. Pour 2 1/2 cups water on top. Bake, uncovered, about 1 1/2 hours. Take a spoon and push down into wheat to make sure it seems quite moist throughout. Add another  1/2 cup or so of water if it seems dry. Top layer of wheat will become crusty. Continue cooking about 1 1/2 hours longer, until wheat is very tender.  4.  Remove from oven. Allow to sit for 15 minutes. Use a large spoon to fold ingredients together once or twice, adding salt and pepper if necessary, then serve.
Yield: 6 servings.
Note: Bergamot is sold in Greek shops and at www.titanfood.com as pergamont.
Tomato Sushi  Adapted from 48 Restaurant, Athens  Time: 3 1/2 hours
8 ripe plum tomatoes, about 2 1/4 pounds  3 cloves garlic  2 sprigs fresh thyme
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, more for brushing  1 medium onion, finely chopped  1 bay leaf
3/4 cup sushi rice
1/2 cup dried currants  2 tablespoons white rum
1/4 cup rice vinegar  1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon  3 tablespoons julienned mint leaves  1/3 cup toasted pine nuts  Salt and freshly ground white pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin.
1.  Heat oven to 250 degrees. Quarter six tomatoes. Scoop out pulp and seeds and reserve, leaving only flesh attached to skin. Place wedges skin-side down on a foil-lined baking sheet. Slice 2 garlic cloves and scatter on tomatoes, along with leaves from 1 sprig thyme. Place in oven and roast 2 hours. Meanwhile, discard seeds from reserved tomato pulp. Peel and seed remaining tomatoes. Finely chop all. Mince remaining garlic clove.  2.  Heat  1/4 cup olive oil in a heavy 2-quart saucepan. Add onion and remaining garlic and sauté over low heat until soft, about 20 minutes. Add chopped tomatoes, remaining thyme and the bay leaf and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until all liquid has evaporated and mixture barely begins to brown, about 2 hours. Remove from heat and let cool. Remove bay leaf and thyme sprig.  3.  When tomato wedges have finished roasting, remove from oven, scrape off and discard skin and set wedges aside to cool.  4.  Mix sushi rice in a small saucepan with 1 1/4 cups water. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook 15 minutes, until tender. Remove from heat and let sit, covered, for 10 minutes. Place currants in a dish with rum.  5.  Transfer rice to a bowl and mix in vinegar, sugar and cinnamon. Press cooked tomato and onion mixture in a sieve to remove excess oil. Discard oil and fold tomato mixture into rice. Fold in mint, currants with rum and pine nuts. Season with salt and pepper. Let sit for 30 minutes.  6.  Form rice mixture into 24 ovals, using a scant tablespoon for each. Arrange on a platter. Place a piece of roasted tomato on each oval, like fish on sushi. Brush tomatoes with a little oil, sprinkle each with a few grains of cumin and serve.
Yield: 6 servings.
Timbale of Skate  Adapted from Mavrikos Restaurant, Rhodes, Greece  Time: 1 hour, plus 1 hour's chilling
2 skate wings with cartilage, 1 pound each, or 24 ounces lump crab meat  1 cup extra virgin olive oil, if using skate, plus 2 tablespoons for serving  1/3 cup white wine vinegar, if using skate  Juice and grated zest of  1/2 orange  Juice of 1 lemon  2 tablespoons pine nuts  1 tablespoon chopped flat leaf parsley  1 tablespoon chopped cilantro leaves  1 teaspoon capers  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 cup red wine vinegar
1/4 cup aged balsamic vinegar  1 1/2 tablespoons light brown sugar  1 small strip orange peel  3 black peppercorns  Lemon wedges for serving.
1.  Place skate in a saucepan with olive oil and white wine vinegar. Fish should be just about covered. Bring to a simmer and cook on low heat 30 minutes. Let cool in oil. Remove flesh from cartilage and place in a bowl. Fish will become somewhat shredded. If using crab meat instead, place in a bowl.  2.  Blend orange juice and zest, lemon juice, pine nuts, parsley, cilantro and capers in a blender until smooth. Fold into fish or crab meat. Season with salt and pepper. Pack some fish or crab meat into a 4-ounce mold (a  1/2-cup metal measuring cup works fine) and unmold onto a platter. Repeat with remaining fish or crab meat to make 6 timbales. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour.  3.  Meanwhile, bring red wine vinegar, balsamic, brown sugar, orange peel and peppercorns to a boil in a small saucepan. Cook until reduced by half and syrupy. Let cool.  4.  To serve, transfer timbales to individual plates and drizzle a little olive oil on each. Spoon a little syrup on plate around each, garnish with lemon wedges. Serve.
Yield: 6 servings.

TO the people who found inspiration and solace at Manka's Inverness Lodge, word that a fire took down the small restaurant and lodge two hours northwest of San Francisco last week was akin to news that a brilliant, eccentric and dear old friend had passed away.
Manka's fed actors like Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt and writers like Isabel Allende and Robert Haas. It was the place Thomas Keller chose to celebrate his 45th birthday. Michael Bauer, the executive food and wine editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, ate Thanksgiving dinner there last year.

Manka's fed actors like Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt and writers like Isabel Allende and Robert Haas. It was the place Thomas Keller chose to celebrate his 45th birthday. Michael Bauer, the executive food and wine editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, ate Thanksgiving dinner there last year.
The draw of Manka's was in part the 1917-era Arts and Crafts main lodge building, filled with original Stickley furniture and four rustic but carefully imagined guest rooms. Some of it was location, above foggy Tomales Bay and just east of the wild Pacific Ocean shoreline.
The heart of Manka's, though, is Margaret Grade (pronounced GROD-ee), who in the early '90s weaned herself from a career as a neuropsychologist specializing in AIDS-related research to take over the rickety lodge.
In the ensuing years, she became both the intimate and business partner of the chef Daniel DeLong. Together, they built meals out of ingredients that came from the neighborhood. That includes oysters from the bay across the street -- something even Alice Waters, another frequent guest, can only dream of.
Davia Nelson, a food journalist, ate breakfast at Manka's on Dec. 26, the day before the fire. Ms. Nelson is half of the public radio duo the Kitchen Sisters, who produce a series called ''Hidden Kitchens.'' What struck her about that Boxing Day breakfast were the descriptions on the menu, which started with satsuma juice and included candied ginger scones with ''coastal whipped dream'' and ''an Inverness egg keeping company with grits and a healthy bite of housemade bacon.'' It ended with two sorbets.
''Need I say more?'' Ms. Nelson wrote in an e-mail message describing her meal. ''A duet of sorbets for breakfast. Cream upon cream upon pork upon egg.''
The soul of Manka's was most evident in those menu descriptions, which reflected Ms. Grade's quirky notions of food.
''She once told me she was nestling a duck egg next to the duck leg, returning the baby to its mother,'' Ms. Nelson wrote.
The night of the blaze, which fire officials believe started when high winds blew a tree into the lodge and damaged a water heater, Ms. Grade first made sure the guests were safe. Elizabeth Falkner, one of San Francisco's most notable pastry chefs, evacuated along with Maggie and Jake Gyllenhaal, the acting siblings. Ms. Grade walked around the building with a sort of detached curiosity as the fire consumed her collection of antiques, log bed frames and fine linens. She was, she imagines, a bit in shock.
''Then I heard my ovens fall,'' she said. It was then that the tears came.
The couple plans to rebuild. Meanwhile, they will keep cooking. Using some of the undamaged outlying buildings, they plan a dinner for the neighbors who supply their food, a veterinarian who raises rabbits and the local egg guy among them.
But first, on Friday, they will hold a dinner that will serve as a wake for the inn.
''I'm from the Midwest and that's all we do when someone dies,'' Ms. Grade said. ''We bring in the bad macaroni salad. Except in this case, it will be good macaroni salad.''

IT would be easy to feel cynical about Mai House.
Here comes the restaurateur Drew Nieporent, a one-man larder for much of TriBeCa, larding the neighborhood with another clangorous destination for buzz-conscious diners.
Combining Vietnamese flavors with other Asian influences and many of the go-to meats of the moment, Mai House produces an unusually appealing roster of dishes.
IT would be easy to feel cynical about Mai House.
Here comes the restaurateur Drew Nieporent, a one-man larder for much of TriBeCa, larding the neighborhood with another clangorous destination for buzz-conscious diners.
Here come the rolls, skewers, noodles and black cod of an Asian-themed menu with echoes of many others. Here come the house cocktails, nearly a dozen of them, with their flavored vodkas, fruit purées, pronounced sweetness and attendant questions: when did the line between adults' elixirs and children's punch become so thin? Is this happy hour or recess?
Cynicism would be easy, no question. But it would be a mistake. It would also be hard to maintain for anyone who takes a seat, grabs a set of chopsticks and makes his or her way through the menu, rife with surprises and out-and-out delights.
Combining Vietnamese flavors with other Asian influences and many of the go-to meats of the moment, Mai House produces an unusually appealing roster of dishes, the best of which make statements at once louder and more nuanced than those at less thoughtful restaurants with roots in Southeast Asia.
Credit for that goes largely to its chef, Michael Huynh, who is also an owner of Mai House. But credit goes as well to Mr. Nieporent, who had the good sense to pluck Mr. Huynh from Bao 111 in the East Village, shuttle him across town and set him up with a bigger budget, kitchen and stage.
At Bao 111, which opened in 2003, I was consistently impressed by Mr. Huynh's refusal to coddle diners with indiscriminate sweetness or assault them with intemperate heat.
But I was also convinced that while he had a fine arsenal of ideas and ingredients, he and his partners, who now operate Bao 111 without much involvement from him, hadn't aced the running of a restaurant. Dishes were overcooked. Service was erratic.
Enter Mr. Nieporent, to some extent repeating what he did in mid-2005 when he opened the Mexican restaurant Centrico in TriBeCa. For Centrico he also forged a partnership with a rising chef who had garnered attention at a less splashy enterprise in a less upscale neighborhood. The chef in that case was Aarón Sánchez, the force behind Paladar on the Lower East Side.
Mai House works better than Centrico, though it's not as visually arresting. By the design standards of downtown restaurants with more than 100 seats, it's a tame affair, making do for the most part with exposed brick, latticed woodwork, silk panels, a semi-open kitchen and dangling lighting fixtures that look like overgrown, airborne Hostess Sno Balls.
There are more impressive efforts on the plates. Mr. Huynh has transplanted some of the dishes from Bao 111, tweaked others, come up with new creations and, of course, raised the prices, though not absurdly.
At Bao 111 he wrapped thinly sliced beef short rib around thick stalks of lemon grass. At Mai House he swaps in tender lamb -- a combination with a more distinctive personality.
Those improvised skewers were among about a dozen appetizers, a few of which you can skip. Don't bother with the pro forma summer rolls or hot fried mushroom rolls in which the flavor of the mushrooms, including chanterelles and shiitakes, didn't fully come through.
But don't miss a thick white yam soup with a bevy of succulent rock shrimp and bracing currents of a classic fish sauce.
Make sure to try crunchy nuggets of cuttlefish, which answered the pesky question of how to give fried calamari a fresh spin. Easy: substitute a sea creature that's a close cousin, but more delicate, and limit the seasoning of the rice-flour batter to salt and pepper.
But the best appetizer of all was an exquisitely balanced salad with ribbons of grilled hanger steak folding under, over and around pineapple, pomelo, kaffir lime, cucumber, chili pepper and rau ram, a minty herb often called the Vietnamese coriander. The salad had heat, tartness and a teasing sweetness that never went overboard or wore you out. It was serene and sassy, juicy and crisp.
Mr. Huynh cranked up the fire for two of the best entrees. One was a clay pot of cubed chicken and whole quail eggs swimming in a deep pool of fish sauce and chicken stock. The irresistible perfume of lemon grass rose from the pot, lulling you into a calm soon shattered, in the happiest of ways, by bird's eye chilies.
The comparable heat in the spicy house laksa, an Asian soup of sorts, spread through a thick, tawny curry stippled with fat, squiggly noodles. As a bonus, a gigantic prawn jutted up from the surface, ready to be reeled in and gobbled up.
A purée of toasted curry powder, cream, cauliflower and white pepper formed the backdrop for spicy beef cheeks in another standout entree. And in another, Mr. Huynh jazzed up what could have been a familiar pinwheel of duck breast slices by laying them over a fried hash of daikon radish, rice flour and duck confit.
As for that black cod, it defied convention by spurning miso. Instead the impeccably steamed fish hooked up with king mushrooms and an ecologically incorrect shark fin consommé that contributed little to the taste of the dish but plenty to its pleasantly sweaty, slippery texture.
As with the appetizers, there were entrees that didn't measure up, among them a mash of glass noodles and Dungeness crab in which the crab didn't register, and, similarly, a mix of rice noodles and lobster in which the lobster took too retiring a role. The lobster appeared in a category of noodle and fried rice dishes that represented one of the menu's weaker spans.
Desserts were another letdown, with the notable exception of an almond and banana cake whose sauce of coconut-flavored tapioca became more engrossing with each bite.
And with the equally notable exception of sticky rice with Chinese sausage, the sides (sautéed long beans, steamed mustard greens) seemed like afterthoughts, or rather like connivances to plump up the apparent bounty of the menu and the amount of the check.
Is that too negative a read? While Mai House provides enough pleasure to keep cynical thoughts in check, it doesn't banish them altogether.

IT was with great indifference that I dropped in on Pardo's, a month-old spot on Seventh Avenue South in the West Village.
I had no history with the place, an offshoot of an established chain in Peru and Chile making its first foray onto North American soil. I had no particular reason to be so suspect.
If you’re in the mood for authentic Peruvian poultry, the spit-roasted pollo alla brasa at Pardo’s is worth the trip.
IT was with great indifference that I dropped in on Pardo's, a month-old spot on Seventh Avenue South in the West Village.
I had no history with the place, an offshoot of an established chain in Peru and Chile making its first foray onto North American soil. I had no particular reason to be so suspect.
But given the nasty number that chain restaurants usually do on chicken, and given the nasty number that dining in chain restaurants can do to your soul, my apprehension made sense.
In Pardo's corner, though, was the fact that it dishes up Peruvian cuisine, which borrows freely from Chinese, Japanese, Spanish and African cooking as it makes the best of the country's indigenous larder. It typically makes for good eating in even the most modest of settings.
Right off the bat, the wait staff at Pardo's helped to ease my nerves. Servers managed sunny dispositions, even if they were made to wear shiny name tags and to work in an overlighted dining room that would make a Starbucks look like the pinnacle of interior design.
And they helpfully suffered silly questions from inattentive diners, even when they could have snidely told them to look at the Denny's-style, picture-filled menu and figure out what yuquitas ($4) are for themselves. (Think of them as Incan fries: fried batons of starchy yucca, creamy inside and crunchy outside, served salted to the hilt, like pretty much everything at Pardo's.)
But what will allow Pardo's to rise above the chain landscape is its spit-roasted chicken, the pollo alla brasa. The chickens are very good: the skin is crisp, the flesh is moist, from the plumpest part of the meaty breast to the nubby ends of the well-seasoned legs.
Are they a revelation? Maybe not, but they are an excellent option for harried West Villagers who don't want to sully their town house kitchens to put a roast bird on table. (It is $14 for a whole chicken, $7.50 for a half and $5 for a quarter.)
Homely oversize posters on the restaurant's walls and reading lines on the menu will hammer it into your head that the chickens are cooked with ''14 secret ingredients.''
Salt is apparent, as is pepper, and I'd wager that cumin is in there somewhere.
Another design-school-dropout poster touts Pardo's employment of rosemary and a South American herb called huacatay, so I would guess that those are in there, too. No one at the restaurant would give out any more information about the marinade than that.
Beyond the rotisserie chicken, there's grilled marinated chicken (boneless half chickens for $9, quarters for $6), subpar fried chicken bits ($7) and chicken fried rice, or chaufa ($11).
Fried rice that isn't overly greasy can only be so bad, and the rice at Pardo's is pretty good. But other than a healthy dose of onion, there isn't much to distinguish it from any other competently executed version of the dish.
Side dishes include very good canario beans ($4) cooked with pork, garlic and ají amarillo, a slightly spicy yellow pepper that is enshrined on its own poster on the dining room wall in a portion large enough to serve two.
There are also serviceable fried plantains ($3.50), meal-stretching seasoned rice ($3.50) and ears of Inca corn ($4), a type of corn with big, prehistoric-looking kernels but, sadly, little flavor.
If you're not in the mood for poultry, you're probably in the wrong place, unless you're feeling like a little bit of anticucho, grilled beef heart in another (or the same?) top secret Peruvian marinade.
A little beefy, a little bloody-tasting, the skewered and grilled bits of heart were good enough to entice a dining companion who had never before savored that particular flesh into polishing off an $8 portion almost without assistance, except from his pisco sour, that classic Peruvian cocktail of pisco, lime, egg white and bitters.
That drink was actually a bit of a revelation. What other fast-food joint would serve cocktails, especially one so conscientiously executed.
The waitress used a tasting spoon to check the drinks she was making. I couldn't remember the last time I saw that at a nonchain restaurant, not to mention one that just winged its way up from Peru.

ALL the nations surrounding the Caspian Sea can resume exporting sevruga and osetra caviar, an international environmental agency ruled yesterday. The agency, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, or Cites, said the nations' efforts to monitor the depletion of endangered sturgeon had improved.
Last year Cites banned almost all Caspian caviar exports by refusing to issue export quotas. It said that four of the countries bordering the sea had not provided enough information to determine the extent to which sturgeon stocks were being depleted by poaching, pollution, overfishing and development.
Countries along the Caspian Sea may resume exporting sevruga and osetra caviar. But coveted beluga is still banned.
ALL the nations surrounding the Caspian Sea can resume exporting sevruga and osetra caviar, an international environmental agency ruled yesterday. The agency, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, or Cites, said the nations' efforts to monitor the depletion of endangered sturgeon had improved.
Last year Cites banned almost all Caspian caviar exports by refusing to issue export quotas. It said that four of the countries bordering the sea had not provided enough information to determine the extent to which sturgeon stocks were being depleted by poaching, pollution, overfishing and development.
Iran, the only exception in 2006, was allowed to export about 100,000 pounds of osetra because its documentation was acceptable.
The quotas issued by Cites for the 2007 harvest cover three kinds of sturgeon -- sevruga, osetra from the northern Caspian, and Iranian osetra -- for all Caspian Sea countries, Iran, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkmenistan.
No quotas were given for beluga sturgeon, which is considered the most endangered of the major caviar sturgeons, and produces the most expensive caviar.
The total allowable caviar exports from the Caspian, about 82 tons, will be about 15 percent lower than it was in 2005, the last year that quotas were issued. Cites said the five nations had voluntarily reduced their overall sturgeon catch by about 20 percent.
''The decision taken by Cites last year not to publish caviar quotas has undoubtedly helped to spur improvements to the monitoring programs and scientific assessments carried out jointly by the five Caspian neighbors,'' Cites's secretary general, Willem Wijnstekers, said in a statement yesterday. ''However, ensuring that sturgeon stocks recover to safe levels will take decades of careful fisheries management and an unrelenting struggle against poaching and illegal trade.''
Armen Petrossian, the president of Petrossian, a major caviar dealer, was pleased. ''Keeping the door closed encourages the black market,'' Mr. Petrossian said. ''You have to establish quotas to create commercial interest.''
But Ellen K. Pikitch, the lead scientist for Caviar Emptor, a coalition of environmental groups, said Cites's decision was a poor one that would harm sturgeon populations.
''They've provided no evidence that the populations can sustain this increased trade,'' Dr. Pikitch said. ''Cites has a bad track record on controlling the trade. They use the export quota system as a lever, turning it on and off, and there is no evidence that it works.''
She called for a complete moratorium on sturgeon fishing.
After sturgeon stocks declined sharply in the 1990s, Cites began regulating the caviar trade in 1998. The 169 nations that belong to Cites voluntarily agree to abide by its decisions. Most countries will not accept imports of caviar without proper Cites documentation.
Caviar dealers expect the ruling to cause prices to drop 10 or 15 percent, both for existing supplies of Caspian caviar and for farmed caviar.
But Caspian caviar from 2007 will not be available for at least two months. Except for Iranian osetra, any Caspian caviar now being sold is a year or two old, or illegal.

But nonfiction doesn't quite describe what Ms. Bruno does. Her work takes risks with form to imply that individual suffering and transcendence are but particles in a river of spiritual energy that dwarfs geography and time.
Ms. Bruno's attempts to realize this vision don't always come off. ''Sacrifice'' pushes too hard, employing impressionistic slow motion and a free-floating monologue that occasionally suggests ''Born Into Brothels'' by way of ''Hiroshima Mon Amour.'' The movie is more compelling when it's listening to lifelong sex workers describe the friendships and rituals that make life bearable.
But the two shorts achieve Ms. Bruno's aim, deploying surprisingly timed cuts and continuous sound elements (chants, barking dogs, desolate wind) to mimic a trancelike state. The straightforward interviews in ''Leper'' are enclosed by wordless, plainly beautiful images of life in a marginalized village.
In ''Sky Burial,'' Ms. Bruno's camera lingers on backpacks containing corpses lugged up into the mountains; it's as if those packs contain not dead flesh, but living spirits.
Sacrifice, Leper and Sky Burial  Opens today in Manhattan.
Three films written, directed, photographed and edited by Ellen Bruno: ''Sacrifice'' (in English, Burmese and Thai, with English subtitles); ''Leper'' (in Nepali, with English subtitles); and ''Sky Burial'' (in Tibetan, with English subtitles). At Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village. Total program running time: 87 minutes. These films are not rated.

114 <html><head><b><center>In Croatia, An Empty Life In Full View<center></b></head><p align="left">Jeannette Catsoulis reviews film I Love You (Volim Te), written and directed by Dalibor Matanic; Kresimir Mikic stars (M)
''I Love You,'' a bleak drama from the Croatian writer and director Dalibor Matanic, is an unusually perceptive scrutiny of absence and emptiness. Set in the filmmaker's hometown, Zagreb, the movie follows a young advertising hotshot named Kreso (Kresimir Mikic), whose life is a thoughtless round of drinking, drugs and sex. When he gets into trouble, his lawyer father bails him out; when he is lonely, his gym buddies are preferable to the live-in girlfriend he barely speaks to. Then he learns he is H.I.V.-positive.
Countering an admittedly trite premise -- personal growth through unexpected adversity -- with an atmosphere of haunting sterility, Mr. Matanic and his cinematographer, Branko Linta, wash the screen in the palest of grays, infused with mutating pastels. As Kreso's life is stripped away (''The company has to be clean, both inside and out,'' says his unrepentant boss as he shows him the door), Kreso's surroundings appear increasingly insubstantial and his connections with others more raw and violent. It is a furiously unsympathetic role, and Mr. Mikic -- a lean Adrien Brody look-alike -- tackles it with compelling urgency.

Opening and closing beneath the clinical glare of hospital lights, ''I Love You'' conjures a disaffected post-Communist life of casual hedonism and emotional bankruptcy. In its simple, unforced way, the movie is as much about the loss of a generation as the redemption of an individual.

Written (in Croatian, with English subtitles) and directed by Dalibor Matanic; director of photography, Branko Linta; edited by Tomislav Pavlic; music by Jura Ferina and Pavle Miholjevic; produced by Mario Oreskovic; released by the Doors Art Foundation. At the Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, at Avenue A, East Village. Running time: 83 minutes. This film is not rated.

Killings<center></b></head><p align="left">Fernando DeCampoamor is charged with murdering Amelia Garcia and her 30-year-old son Ferneliz Cruz in Coram, NY; police say he lent money to companion Garcia and became enraged over delay in repayment; was on parole for 1985 murder in New York City; previous record noted (M)
A parolee who has served more than 30 years in prison for two separate homicides and other violent crimes in New York City was arrested yesterday by the Suffolk County police and charged in the shooting deaths of a 52-year-old woman and her 30-year-old son over the weekend.
The man, Fernando DeCampoamor, 59, of Mount Sinai, N.Y., was scheduled to be arraigned today on two counts of second-degree murder in the deaths of the woman, Amelia Garcia, and her son, Ferneliz Cruz, the authorities said. They were found shot once in the head in the basement apartment in Coram where they lived with Mr. Cruz's wife and their two small children.

A parolee who has served more than 30 years in prison for two separate homicides and other violent crimes in New York City was arrested yesterday by the Suffolk County police and charged in the shooting deaths of a 52-year-old woman and her 30-year-old son over the weekend.
The man, Fernando DeCampoamor, 59, of Mount Sinai, N.Y., was scheduled to be arraigned today on two counts of second-degree murder in the deaths of the woman, Amelia Garcia, and her son, Ferneliz Cruz, the authorities said. They were found shot once in the head in the basement apartment in Coram where they lived with Mr. Cruz's wife and their two small children.
According to the police, the suspect told investigators he had lent money to Ms. Garcia, whom he described as his companion of six months, and became enraged Saturday evening over what he said was a delay in repayment.
Mr. Cruz and his family had spent that early evening at a nearby self-service laundry. He had returned home first with a few loads of clean clothes. His wife, Yessenia Hernandez, and their children, an 8-year-old and a 2-month-old, returned to the apartment 20 minutes later to find Ms. Garcia dead and Mr. Cruz severely wounded. He died on Sunday night, about 24 hours later, at Stony Brook University Medical Center.
It was unclear whether Mr. Cruz had returned to the apartment, on Marie Lane, before his mother was shot or after, the police said.
Detective Lt. Jack Fitzpatrick of the Suffolk police said that according to state records, Mr. DeCampoamor was convicted of a murder in Brooklyn in 1961 and paroled in 1967. In 1968, he was convicted in connection with a nonfatal shooting and sentenced to 15 years in prison. He was paroled in 1975. In 1985, he was sentenced to 81/3 to 25 years in prison for manslaughter in connection with a killing in Queens. He was paroled in 2003 and had been working recently as a tow truck driver.
Lieutenant Fitzpatrick said he did not know whether Ms. Garcia had any knowledge of Mr. DeCampoamor's criminal background.
Neighbors and friends said Ms. Garcia and Mr. Cruz immigrated from the Dominican Republic about 12 years ago. Ms. Garcia helped care for her son's children while he and his wife worked. Neighbors said he worked full time for a bakery and bread distributing company, and might have held other part-time jobs, including one as a waiter. His wife worked part time at a local fast-food restaurant.
A neighbor, Darlene Kennedy, 32, described the family as close-knit and unfailingly polite. She said the 8-year-old, Yerneli, who played with her children, was cheerful and very bright and seemed to love learning new games.
From the open door of the family's basement apartment, which was covered in black dust left by police fingerprint technicians on Monday, a chess board and chess pieces could be seen on the kitchen table. Blood was pooled on the linoleum.

Wondering what happened to your lost airline luggage?
If you flew through Houston over Christmas, check with the police. They may have it.
The arrests followed the discovery on Dec. 26 of 68 pieces of looted luggage in a trash bin outside a pet store in north Houston.
Wondering what happened to your lost airline luggage?
If you flew through Houston over Christmas, check with the police. They may have it.
Officials on Tuesday announced the arrest of five men charged with stealing the bags, including 23-year-old twins. All worked for a contractor at George Bush Intercontinental Airport handling luggage between connecting flights within a secure area of the airport. Officials provided few details, saying the investigation was continuing.
The arrests followed the discovery of 68 pieces of looted luggage on Dec. 26 in a trash bin outside a pet store in north Houston. Since then, said Capt. Rick Bownds, commander of the Houston Police Department's airport division, more than 90 additional pieces have turned up in two other places.
''We're still uncovering leads and information as we speak,'' he said, adding that virtually every airline at the airport was probably affected by the thefts.
The five men, all charged with one felony count of engaging in an organized criminal activity, worked for Menzies Aviation, which operates in 23 countries and 100 airports, including 15 in the United States, providing passenger, ramp and cargo services. All had credentials to work in secure areas of the airport, and all the luggage taken was being transferred between connecting flights, Captain Bownds said.
John Fulford, a Menzies vice president, said that theft was a continuing issue across the industry and that the company had a ''zero tolerance'' policy and planned to ''take robust action.'' He said he was not aware of any similar thefts by company employees in the United States.
Richard Vacar, director of the Houston airport system, said that to receive an airport identification badge a person's identity and fingerprints are submitted to a clearinghouse and the federal government conducts background checks. He declined to provide details but said that there was a list of disqualifying felonies and that the record check goes back 10 years.
Mark Mancuso, deputy director of safety for the airport system, said once the criminal investigation was complete, the airport system would conduct its own investigation into employment practices. For now, the police said they were working with the airlines to track down the owners of the luggage. One of the problems, since these were bags in transit, is that travelers would not realize the luggage was missing until arriving at their final destination.
Nor do the police yet have a good idea of what was stolen.
''It's a matter of locating the owners of the bag to find out what items were reported missing,'' Captain Bownds said.

Indonesian officials reversed themselves on Tuesday and admitted that they did not know what had happened to a passenger jet that disappeared from radar screens in bad weather on Monday shortly after issuing a distress signal.
On Monday, Indonesian Air Force and Transport Ministry officials told local and foreign news services that wreckage from a 17-year-old Boeing 737-400 operated by Adam Air had been found strewn on jungle-covered mountainside on Sulawesi island. They also said 12 of the 102 people on board had survived.
Indonesian officials reversed themselves on Tuesday and admitted that they did not know what had happened to a passenger jet that disappeared from radar screens in bad weather on Monday shortly after issuing a distress signal.
On Monday, Indonesian Air Force and Transport Ministry officials told local and foreign news services that wreckage from a 17-year-old Boeing 737-400 operated by Adam Air had been found strewn on jungle-covered mountainside on Sulawesi island. They also said 12 of the 102 people on board had survived.
But later they said reports that the wreckage and survivors had been found were wrong. Officials said they had been misled by incorrect information from villagers and local officials in the remote area where the reports had originated.
''We apologize for the news that we released earlier,'' said Eddy Suyanto, an air force official, The Associated Press reported. ''It was not true.''
Indonesian officials said they planned to resume the search for the plane on Wednesday.
The presumed crash was another loss for the Indonesian aviation industry, which boomed after deregulation in 1999 led to the founding of several low-cost airlines but which has had a long history of accidents.
It was a particularly bitter blow to Adam Adhitya Suherman, 26, the president of Adam SkyConnection Airlines. In an Indonesian industry known for bankruptcies and safety problems, Mr. Suherman and his family of Chinese traders had aimed to create a reliable and relatively inexpensive airline for a rapidly growing pool of Indonesian travelers. And they seemed to be succeeding.
From a shoestring domestic operation, started in 2003 with three leased Boeing 737s, the airline grew by 2006 into a $300 million-a-year business, flying 19 planes to 25 domestic and international destinations and harboring big ambitions for growth. The family's goal for 2006 was to carry six million to eight million passengers. It was courted by big investors, including Qantas and Tiger Airways.
While emphasizing safety, the airline has had its share of troubles. On Feb. 11 last year, an Adam Air flight to Makassar from Jakarta lost its way, making an unscheduled landing hundreds of miles off course in eastern Indonesia. The pilots blamed a malfunction in the navigation equipment but Mr. Suherman said it had been working properly.
On May 31, 2005, part of the landing gear of a Boeing 737 operated by Adam Air collapsed on landing at the Jakarta airport.
More Rescued After Ferry Sinking
REMBANG, Indonesia, Jan. 2 (AP) -- Fishing boats rescued dozens of people from the sea on Tuesday, four days after a ferry sank in a storm off Indonesia, but 400 people remained missing.
The ferry Senopati Nusantara foundered after being pounded by heavy waves for more than 10 hours as it neared the end of a two-day journey to Java, Indonesia's main island, from the Indonesian section of Borneo island. Officials said the bad weather caused the sinking.
About 200 survivors have been found, and officials say the search will continue until Sunday. Thirteen bodies have been recovered and scores more have been seen floating at sea.
Susilo, 35, was picked up by fishermen and taken to a hospital with chest pains and respiratory problems after drifting four days in a life raft.
''Six among us died, one by one,'' said Mr. Susilo, who like many Indonesians uses one name. Some who died drank seawater, he said.

The Israeli chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Halutz, conceded Tuesday that the military had made serious errors during last summer's war against Hezbollah in Lebanon but said he would not resign his post.
General Halutz said Israel had badly damaged Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and killed ''hundreds of terrorists.'' But he said Israel was ''not successful in reducing the short-range rocket fire on Israel's north until the cease-fire,'' which came after 34 days of fighting.
The Israeli chief of staff said Israel was “not successful in reducing the short-range rocket fire on Israel’s north until the cease-fire.”
The Israeli chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Halutz, conceded Tuesday that the military had made serious errors during last summer's war against Hezbollah in Lebanon but said he would not resign his post.
General Halutz said Israel had badly damaged Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and killed ''hundreds of terrorists.'' But he said Israel was ''not successful in reducing the short-range rocket fire on Israel's north until the cease-fire,'' which came after 34 days of fighting.
Critics of General Halutz and of the Israeli government of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert have said the military relied too heavily on air power and delayed too long sending in ground troops in the numbers needed to push back the Hezbollah fighters and supporters who were firing Katyusha rockets into Israel.
Critics have also said that the military should be led by a ground forces commander -- General Halutz spent his career in the air force -- and that reserves were not called up in time, were badly trained and equipped, and often faced contradictory orders.
''We attacked the Katyushas, but unsuccessfully,'' General Halutz said.
He spoke Tuesday at a Tel Aviv news conference summing up the army's own investigation of its behavior during the war.
He said he would stay on ''to correct what can be corrected,'' and said to resign now would be ''running away.'' He said Mr. Olmert and Defense Minister Amir Peretz had not asked him to go. ''I have not heard my superiors calling on me to resign,'' he said. ''If they do, I will respond.''
He suggested that discipline had broken down to some degree. ''There were cases in which officers did not carry out their assignments, and cases in which officers objected on moral grounds to their orders,'' he said, an apparent reference to resistance against attacking southern Lebanese towns and villages.
He said that those instances of refusal ''ran counter to the army's basic values'' and that a senior officer was suspended as a result.
During the war, as criticism mounted, General Halutz effectively demoted the commander of the northern front, Maj. Gen. Udi Adam, putting the deputy chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Moshe Kaplinski, alongside him. General Adam later quit the army.
Previously, General Halutz has said the army fired some cluster munitions, with the ''bomblets'' placed in artillery shells, into southern Lebanon in contradiction of his orders that they be aimed only at specific targets.
The United States is investigating whether the Israelis used cluster munitions made and paid for in America in ways that contravene American regulations for the weapons' use.
General Halutz implicitly criticized Mr. Olmert for setting as a goal of the war the release of two Israeli soldiers captured by Hezbollah in a cross-border raid on July 12, an act that set off the fighting.
The Winograd committee, which is led by a retired judge, Eliyahu Winograd, and was appointed by the government, is still investigating the conflict and its outcome.
General Halutz said that if the committee called for his resignation, ''of course'' he would comply. Defense Minister Amir Peretz has made the same pledge.
The war ended with a cease-fire on Aug. 14, after a United Nations Security Council resolution mandated an enlarged and strengthened international peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon and supervision of Lebanon's seacoast and border with Syria to prevent the rearming of Hezbollah.
The fighting left more than 1,000 people dead on both sides. Israel says more than 500 of the dead were Hezbollah fighters, but Hezbollah disputes that.
Israel counted 159 fatalities, including 39 civilians who were killed by the more than 4,000 rockets Hezbollah fired into Israel.
In Gaza on Tuesday, Palestinian security forces were searching for a Peruvian photographer for Agence France-Presse, Jaime Razuri, 50, a day after his abduction.
The Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, said he was hopeful. ''We're sure he will soon be released,'' Mr. Abbas told a delegation from the news agency and French and Peruvian diplomats. ''In past incidents of this kind, hostages have been freed after one or two days.''
In the latest in a string of foreigner abductions, several unmasked gunmen abducted Mr. Razuri in the center of Gaza City on Monday as he was returning from an assignment with an interpreter and a driver.
Separately, warring Hamas and Fatah factions returned 14 fighters kidnapped on Monday after mediation from representatives of Islamic Jihad, Palestinian officials said.
The violence resumed Monday when Hamas gunmen shot at a brother of a senior Fatah militant in the northern Gaza Strip, violating an earlier deal for a general truce.

Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia said Tuesday that his country, one of the poorest in the world, could not afford to keep troops in Somalia much longer and that it was ill equipped to play the role of peacekeeper there.
Two hours after he spoke, two Ethiopian soldiers were gunned down in an ambush in southern Somalia in one of the first strikes of an anticipated anti-Ethiopian guerrilla campaign.
Ethiopia, one of the poorest countries in the world, could not afford to keep troops in Somalia, the leader said.
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia said Tuesday that his country, one of the poorest in the world, could not afford to keep troops in Somalia much longer and that it was ill equipped to play the role of peacekeeper there.
Two hours after he spoke, two Ethiopian soldiers were gunned down in an ambush in southern Somalia in one of the first strikes of an anticipated anti-Ethiopian guerrilla campaign.
According to residents in Jilib, about 250 miles southwest of Mogadishu, Somalia's capital, a fighter for the Islamist forces, who were routed last week by Ethiopian-led troops, had shot two Ethiopian soldiers while they were crossing a bridge. Witnesses said the fighter then dashed into town and was quickly surrounded by Ethiopian troops, who killed him.
''It was a suicide mission,'' said Mohammed Subiye, a farmer in Jilib.
The Islamist forces, which in the span of one week went from ruling much of Somalia to fleeing into the bush, have vowed to fight a guerrilla insurgency against the Ethiopians, whom they consider infidel invaders.
But Mr. Meles said he did not plan to have his troops to remain in Somalia for much longer, possibly only a few more weeks. The troops were dispatched to neutralize the rising regional threat posed by the Islamists, he said, and now international peacekeepers are needed to bring order to a country that has been synonymous with anarchy for 15 years.
''We don't have the money to take this burden individually,'' Mr. Meles said during a speech to Ethiopia's Parliament.
Diplomats in the region are hurrying to cobble together an African peacekeeping solution, but despite murmurs of commitment from several countries, including Uganda, South Africa and Nigeria, a force has yet to materialize.
Somalia is far from stable, with many heavy weapons still in the hands of warlords, and the country's turmoil is likely to dissuade many nations from volunteering troops.
On Tuesday, Ali Mohammed Gedi, Somalia's transitional prime minister, reiterated his plea for the nation's many gunmen to turn in their weapons. But few seemed to be listening. The collection points across Mogadishu remained empty, and many young men defiantly vowed to keep their guns.
Meanwhile, the remnants of the once-fierce Islamist army continued to flee south from Kismayo, the port city 100 miles from the Kenyan border that had been a final stronghold until the Islamist military definitively collapsed there on Monday.
Kenyan authorities said 10 fighters were apprehended on Monday as they tried to slip through the border disguised as refugees. Eight had Eritrean passports while two had Canadian passports, said Alfred Mutua, a spokesman for the Kenyan government. All of them were carrying briefcases packed with cash.
''They definitely didn't look like refugees,'' Mr. Mutua said.
Mr. Mutua said that the suspects remained in Kenyan custody and that they would probably be returned to Somalia to face charges under the transitional government, though it has not yet set up a justice system.
The Islamists tried to improve their military prospects by calling for a global jihad against Ethiopia, a country with a long Christian history. But in the end, American officials said, only a few hundred foreign fighters answered the call, the bulk of them from Eritrea, Ethiopia's archenemy.
Still, the Islamists were widely believed to have been sheltering several wanted terrorists, and American officials said they were hoping to use the swift collapse of the Islamist forces as an opportunity to capture men they have been chasing for years.
Ships from the Fifth Fleet of the United States Navy, based in Bahrain, have increased patrols off Somalia's coast to prevent any suspects from escaping.
''Yes, we have a presence out there,'' said Lt. Denise Garcia, a spokeswoman for the Fifth Fleet.
So far, though, no suspects have been apprehended.
Somalia continues to be a work in progress. The country's transitional president, Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, has yet to set foot in the capital, and only a select few officials of the transitional government have returned to it. Many of them seem to be pulling in wildly different directions.
On Tuesday, Hussein Mohammed Aideed, the interior minister and son of a notorious warlord, announced that he would like to erase the 1,000-mile long border between Somalia and Ethiopia.
''We should unite, just like the Europeans,'' Mr. Aideed said at a news conference. ''One money. One passport. One security.''
Many Somalis consider Ethiopia a historic enemy and were appalled by the suggestion.
''All I can say is that the interior minister is entitled to his opinion,'' said Abdirahman Dinari, the spokesman for the transitional government. ''But he does not speak on behalf of the government.''

Ali Saleem may have devised the perfect, if improbable, cover for breaking taboos in conservative, Muslim Pakistan.
In a country where publicly talking about sex is strictly off limits, Mr. Saleem has managed not only to bring up the subject on his prime-time television talk show -- but to do so without stirring a backlash from fundamentalist Islamic clerics.
In Pakistan, where publicly talking about sex is off limits, it takes a cross-dressing television host to take on the most sensitive subjects.
Ali Saleem may have devised the perfect, if improbable, cover for breaking taboos in conservative, Muslim Pakistan.
In a country where publicly talking about sex is strictly off limits, Mr. Saleem has managed not only to bring up the subject on his prime-time television talk show -- but to do so without stirring a backlash from fundamentalist Islamic clerics.
And he has done so as a woman.
When Mr. Saleem takes to the airwaves, he is Begum Nawazish Ali, a coquettish widow who interviews Pakistan's glitterati and some of its top politicians.
A real woman could not possibly do what Mr. Saleem does. In the unlikely event a station would broadcast such a show, the hostess would be shunned. And taking on the guise of a married woman -- whose virtue is crucial to her whole family -- would be equally impossible.
But apparently a cross-dressing man pretending to be a widow is another matter entirely.
It is something of a mystery why a man who openly acknowledges he is bisexual is a sensation here. Traditional Islamic teaching rejects bisexuals and gays, and gay Pakistanis have few outlets for a social life. The gay party scenes in Lahore and Karachi are deep underground.
Mr. Saleem has his own theory for his popularity: he thinks Pakistan has always been more open than outsiders believed.
It is true that Pakistan is, in a sense, two countries. There is urban, and urbane, Pakistan, where Western mores are more accepted, although nudity would never be seen on television or scantily clad women on billboards. And then there is rural Pakistan, where Islam is generally practiced with more fervor.
It is also true that the Pakistani president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, is relatively tolerant about what the media can show and cover, including politics. Although General Musharraf came to power in a bloodless coup by the military in 1999, he has been more open to political criticism in the press than some of his democratic predecessors.
Mr. Saleem, 28, is thrilled with his success for reasons that are both political (he is proud to be breaking ground in bringing up tough subjects) and profoundly personal. ''My biggest high is to see myself gorgeous in the mirror'' he said recently while reclining in a makeup-room chair. As a beautician outlined his eyes, adding glitter and eye shadow, he said, ''Maybe, yes, I am a diva.''
It is hard to judge how successful Mr. Saleem's show is -- there is no form of Nielsen ratings here. And there are clearly people who find the show revolting.
But by many measures, it is a success. Television critics have been generally supportive, and the show, which has been on a year and a half, has a prime-time slot despite its name, ''Late Night Show With Begum Nawazish Ali.'' Mr. Saleem said it was named for its racy content, usually shown late, but he said the network scheduled it earlier hoping for a hit that would bring in more advertising revenue.
Urbanites, meanwhile, seem not to be able to get enough of the once-a-week show, which is rerun twice each week. They have showered praise on Mr. Saleem's portrayal of a middle-aged widow who, in glamorous saris and glittery diamonds, invites to her drawing room politicians, movie stars and rights advocates from Pakistan and India.
With fluttering eyelids and glossy lips, Begum Nawazish Ali (Begum means Lady or Mrs. in Urdu) flirts with male guests using suggestive banter and sexual innuendo. With female guests, she is something of a tease, challenging them about who looks better. Questions are pointed and piercing. Politics, democracy and saucy gossip are enmeshed in her conversation.
Mr. Saleem sees the show's acceptance and commercial success as a testimony to the tolerance and moderation of Pakistan, a country often seen by the outside world as teetering on the edges of militancy and extremism.
Colorful and witty, Mr. Saleem is open about his own sexuality and sprinkles his conversation with gender-bending phrases. ''My life fluctuates between two extremes,'' he says. ''I always say this: I am a man and I am a woman. It is two gender extremes, and I am constantly trying to balance it.''
He is unabashed at the criticism that his show often borders on raunchiness. ''Sitting senators have sent requests to be on the show,'' he says.
Mr. Saleem has also been willing to take on tough political subjects. He is openly critical of the army's role in ruling Pakistan, for instance.
His show is not the only one pushing the envelope on that and other touchy subjects.
In another network television program, ''Aalim Online,'' religious scholars from Shiite and Sunni sects sat side by side and responded to viewers' queries on different issues from their respective viewpoints.
Television talk shows and news programs have also openly criticized the policies of previous governments on their support for the Taliban and on their policies in Kashmir, which both India and Pakistan claim.
President Musharraf's policies and the role of the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, have come under fire on talk shows and analysis programs, something unimaginable some years ago.
That is not to say that anything goes. The restrictions on print media are generally tougher than for broadcast journalists, and some subjects are considered clearly off limits.
Owais Aslam Ali, secretary general of Pakistan Press Foundation, an independent media research center in Karachi, said that ''on things of consequence, restrictions remain.'' He said that included reporting on the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan, where the Taliban and Al Qaeda are taking refuge.
Mr. Ali said there also were unstated restrictions on reporting about Baluchistan, the southwestern province where a low-level civil insurgency has long simmered. ''This is a big black hole as far as media is concerned,'' he said. ''Parameters have been set. You cross those parameters at your own peril.''
Mr. Saleem, who in the guise of Begum Nawazish Ali often gets away with questions to politicians that print journalists might be wary of, said his show would not have been a possibility earlier. ''I owe Begum Nawazish Ali's existence, in a certain way, to General Musharraf,'' he said.
But he appears to know his own limits. He shrugged when asked if he should not invite the general himself on the show, appearing to indicate that he knew that was one taboo he could not break. But it did not stop him from flirting with the idea, especially after General Musharraf made himself so open to the media during his book tour of the United States last year.
''I would love it if Musharraf would come on the show,'' he said. ''If he can go on Jon Stewart's show, then why not?''

House Democrats intend to kick off their new regime with a 100-hour legislative blitz that would allow them to post a series of quick victories before President Bush even delivers his State of the Union address toward the end of this month.
But don't pull out that stopwatch to begin the countdown just yet.
House Democrats intend to kick off their new regime with a 100-hour legislative blitz, but there’s a bit of confusion about when the 100 hours begins.
House Democrats intend to kick off their new regime with a 100-hour legislative blitz that would allow them to post a series of quick victories before President Bush even delivers his State of the Union address toward the end of this month.
But don't pull out that stopwatch to begin the countdown just yet.
Even as Democrats filtered back to Capitol Hill on Tuesday in anticipation of the opening of the 110th Congress on Thursday, there was a bit of confusion about just when the 100 hours would officially begin. Would it be as soon as the new Congress was sworn in and began voting on internal rules changes? Or when the House takes up its first actual legislation next Tuesday?
And since it is 100 hours of strictly legislative activity, the clock would be on pause when House members give their customary one-minute speeches at the start of each day and during the ''special orders'' at night when members reserve floor time to carry on about their favorite issues for the C-Span audience.
And next Monday is out since the House, despite Democratic pledges of a disciplined five-day work schedule, will not be in session. The day off was scheduled to allow freshman lawmakers time to return from an orientation session -- and others to attend the college football national championship game.
At the same time, House Republicans, forced to the Congressional sidelines for the first time in 12 years, were growing increasingly agitated about the Democratic timetable. They said that the rush by Democrats to force through legislation on national security, the minimum wage, student loan costs and energy without a full slate of hearings -- and with limits on the ability of Republicans to offer alternatives -- undercut the pledges of Democrats to run things in a more transparent, collegial way than the Republicans had when they were in power.
Democrats eventually decided Tuesday that the 100-hour timer would be started next Tuesday, when the House is scheduled to take up H.R. 1, a measure enacting recommendations from the bipartisan Sept. 11 commission that never made it out of the Republican-controlled Congress.
And they brushed aside complaints from the Republicans, saying Democrats campaigned specifically on this initial flurry of legislation, much of which has been considered, run through committee and ultimately rejected by Republicans in the past.
''These are deliverable,'' Brendan Daly, a spokesman for the incoming House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said of the 100-hour topics. ''These are things we said we would do if we are in charge and would make a direct impact on Americans' lives.''
Under the current Democratic schedule, the Sept. 11 measure would be followed by a vote on increasing the federal minimum wage to $7.25 over two years. Next would come legislation expanding embryonic stem cell research that was vetoed last year by Mr. Bush. Democrats would then move to eliminate a prohibition on federal officials' negotiating with pharmaceutical companies for lower prices for those enrolled in the Medicare drug program.
After that, Democrats are planning to take up a proposal to cut the interest rate on federally subsidized student loans to 3.4 percent from 6.8 percent. Lastly, Democrats hope to wind up on Jan. 18 with legislation that seeks to make sure that oil companies pay adequate royalties on disputed leases, rolls back some industry subsidies from a recent energy bill and creates a renewable energy reserve to try to spur investment in new technologies and conservation.
Before getting to those bills, House Democrats said they would move immediately upon taking control Thursday to pass broad ethics rules including a ban on gifts and meals from lobbyists and restrictions on travel provided by outside groups. On Friday, they will vote on disclosure of earmarks and new budget rules to prohibit deficit spending.
The leadership plans to allow some of the party's freshmen to sponsor changes so they can begin building a record and reputation to defend their seats in 2008.
The pace of activity is to be much slower in the Senate, and passage of any of the legislation by the House does not guarantee that it will be sent to the White House, given the Senate's thin 51-49 Democratic majority.
Leading Senate Republicans have indicated that they could support the minimum wage increase, for instance, only if it is tied to tax relief for small businesses. As a result, that measure is likely to either stall or be changed, leading to negotiations with the House.
The Senate plans to convene Thursday and swear in its new members. But both parties plan to hold retreats on Friday, and aides said the only legislation that could come up for a vote this week would be a resolution honoring former President Gerald R. Ford.
House Republicans, who were not known for giving Democrats much say on legislation when they ran the House, began an orchestrated campaign on Tuesday to pressure Democrats to allow full committee review of the 100-hour legislation.
''As we both know, homeland security is far too important an issue to play politics with, and any new homeland security measure should be given the review and oversight it deserves,'' Representative Peter T. King of New York, the top Republican on the Homeland Security Committee, wrote to Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the incoming Democratic chairman.
Democrats said the legislation at issue had already been vetted and in many cases voted on in the past. They said Republicans would be given their chance once the 100 hours had elapsed. ''After that, we will go back through regular order,'' said Mr. Daly, Ms. Pelosi's spokesman.

It would be an ambitious project even in a Middle Eastern country not embroiled in war: build an American-style university where classes are taught in English, teachers come from around the world and graduates compete for lucrative jobs in fields like business and computer science.
Yet some of the leading lights of Iraq's political and intellectual classes are doing exactly that, even as the bloodshed widens.
The university, which would be built 150 miles north of Baghdad, raises hopes of stanching the country’s enormous brain drain.
It would be an ambitious project even in a Middle Eastern country not embroiled in war: build an American-style university where classes are taught in English, teachers come from around the world and graduates compete for lucrative jobs in fields like business and computer science.
Yet some of the leading lights of Iraq's political and intellectual classes are doing exactly that, even as the bloodshed widens.
Their planned American University of Iraq is modeled after the famous private universities in Cairo and Beirut. The project's managers have a board of trustees; a business plan recently completed by McKinsey & Company, an international consulting firm; three candidates for university president; and $25 million, much of it in pledges from the American government and Kurdish sources. To fulfill their dream, they need much more: $200 million to $250 million over 15 years, said Azzam Alwash, the board's executive secretary.
But if it does become a reality, the university will not be built in Baghdad, which for centuries was a beacon of learning in the Arab world.
Instead, it is slated for what is the most non-Iraqi part of Iraq. The site is on a windswept hilltop along the outskirts of Sulaimaniya, the eastern capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, 150 miles north of Baghdad and far from the car bombs and death squads that are tearing apart the Arab regions of Iraq. Because of its relative safety so far, Kurdistan can more easily attract aid and reconstruction money.
With doctors, engineers, businesspeople, academics and students among the hundreds of thousands fleeing to neighboring countries or the West, the university raises hopes of stanching the country's enormous brain drain and pushing Iraq forward. ''You really need to develop the political elite of the future, the educated elite of the future,'' said Barham Salih, the project's Kurdish founder, a deputy prime minister who received a doctorate in statistics and computer modeling from Liverpool University in Britain, and whose daughter attends Princeton. ''The focus is also to stimulate reform in the Iraqi education system.''
However, some Arab education officials in Baghdad, the capital, have argued that the university should be built there, not in a part of Iraq where secessionist ambitions are well known.
Baghdad first achieved fame for its schools and scholars during the Abbasid caliphate, which reached its height in the eighth century. Even in the 20th century, before the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s and international economic sanctions of the 1990s, students from the region flocked to Baghdad.
But because of security threats, many universities in Baghdad have been closed since October. Up to 150 employees from the Ministry of Higher Education were abducted by men in commando uniforms in mid-November. Jihadist groups have threatened to kill students on campuses.
So intellectuals like Kanan Makiya, the prominent former exile and writer who strongly advocated for the American invasion, say they plan to move their research projects to the American University. Mr. Makiya founded the Iraq Memory Foundation, an organization based in the fortified Green Zone in Baghdad that is documenting Saddam Hussein's atrocities.
''The problem is nobody can thrive in Baghdad anymore,'' said Mr. Makiya, who teaches Middle Eastern studies at Brandeis University and sits on the new university's board of trustees. ''The north is much more stable, growing, prosperous.''
''There is a sadness that we're being driven out of Baghdad,'' he added.
The university's planners plan to make Mr. Makiya's documentary project the core of the humanities department. Mr. Alwash, an environmental scientist, has said he will use the university as a base for his research project, which is about rejuvenating the southern marshlands.
Other prominent intellectual and political figures, many of whom supported the American invasion, are on the board. They include Fouad Ajami, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at Johns Hopkins, and John Agresto, an education adviser in the Coalition Provisional Authority who, as he ended his tenure there in 2004, told a reporter he was ''a neoconservative who's been mugged by reality.''
The planners have sketched a rough schedule. Construction would start in the spring, and the first 15 to 30 students could begin a six-month intensive English course, to be taught in rented space here in Sulaimaniya, before they start a two-year master's program in business administration. The first class to earn bachelor's degrees would start in fall 2008; the program would take five years, with the first devoted to the study of English, Mr. Alwash said.
Although the university has regional aspirations like its counterparts in Cairo and Beirut, the first undergraduate class would be mostly Iraqis, Mr. Alwash said, and a majority probably Kurds.
In the university's first five years, degree programs would focus on subjects that the board judges to be crucial to Iraq's development: business, petroleum engineering and computer science, for example. ''This has to have immediate practical consequences for the economy of Iraq and the politics of Iraq,'' Mr. Salih, the founder, said.
After five years, the university may add humanities degree programs.
''We want them to study the ideas of Locke, the ideas and writings of Paine and Madison,'' Mr. Alwash, the executive secretary, said. ''We want them to understand what democracy is -- not only majority rule, but also the rights of minorities. They should be well rounded.''
Projected undergraduate enrollment is 1,000 students by 2011 and 5,000 by 2021. The numbers are small compared with enrollment at Baghdad University, the country's flagship public university, which has 70,000 students. Sulaimaniya University here has about 12,000 students.
In total, about 475,000 Iraqis are pursuing college-level degrees across the country, in 21 public universities or colleges, 18 private ones and about 40 technical institutes, according to the American Embassy.
Tuition at American University would be $8,500 to $10,000 a year, Mr. Alwash said. That places the university beyond the reach of the average middle-class Iraqi family. But Mr. Salih said the school planned to give loans and scholarships.
Zalmay Khalilzad, the American ambassador and an alumnus of the university in Beirut, has promised that American agencies will give the school $10.5 million, possibly the largest donation by the United States to any single education project in Iraq, if American officials approve the business plan. Mr. Khalilzad, a native Afghan, helped found the American University of Kabul after the American military ousted the Taliban from Afghanistan in 2001.
Some Kurds fear that the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, the governing party of eastern Kurdistan led by Mr. Talabani and Mr. Salih, could end up diverting money from the university for its own purposes. Among many Kurds, the main Kurdish parties have a reputation for corruption and authoritarian rule.
''I hope this will not just be party propaganda, because we need a real academic center for this society,'' said Asos Hardi, the editor in chief of a weekly newspaper here. ''Having a Western-style university in Iraq would help strengthen education here and across the country.''

When Bob Baker at Harvest Partners, a real estate development company, tells people he is putting up a shopping center across the street from Boeing's commercial jet factory, he usually gets quizzical looks. Although Renton, Wash., is a town better known for airplanes than Armani, Mr. Baker is convinced his mall will do well.
Harvest Partners and Transwestern Investment bought the land for $37.8 million from Boeing two years ago and saw the site as ideal for new business. The 46-acre property was close to nearby highways and was centrally situated. Mr. Baker said that he realized that his center would not initially attract stores like Neiman Marcus, Crate & Barrel or Nordstrom, but that his mall would evolve with the city.
Renton, Wash., home to Boeing’s commercial jet factory, is shedding its factory town past to embrace new commercial development.

Although Renton, Wash., is a town better known for airplanes than Armani, Mr. Baker is convinced his mall will do well.
Harvest Partners and Transwestern Investment bought the land for $37.8 million from Boeing two years ago and saw the site as ideal for new business. The 46-acre property was close to nearby highways and was centrally situated. Mr. Baker said that he realized that his center would not initially attract stores like Neiman Marcus, Crate & Barrel or Nordstrom, but that his mall would evolve with the city.
''The moment you say Renton, people think blue collar,'' said Mr. Baker, a partner at Harvest Partners in Dallas. ''We're still fighting that perception every day.''
Renton, 12 miles southeast of Seattle, was founded over a century ago and was initially known for coal mining, logging and brick making until rail cars were produced in the 1920s. Since the 1940s, when Boeing built a factory there, Renton's fortunes have been tied to the airplane industry.
But now the town of 56,840 has quietly been reducing its dependence on the cyclical aerospace industry and courting developers, companies and sports teams to move to town. Renton seems to be positioned well: developable land, speedy permitting, no local business or occupation tax and a location on the south end of Lake Washington.
''All the pieces are finally coming together,'' said Kathy Keolker, Renton's mayor.
Residential developers are putting up million-dollar homes and luxury apartments. The Seattle Seahawks and the Federal Reserve's Seattle branch have either announced projects or have broken ground in Renton during the last two years. The Seattle SuperSonics basketball team is even considering a move.
''A whole lot of work has paid off,'' said Alex Pietsch, administrator of Renton's economic development, neighborhoods and strategic planning. ''We've been working nearly 10 years to promote reasons to do business, play and live here. I think that message is starting to come through.''
Employment in Renton, now home to Boeing's commercial jetliner division, has risen and fallen along with military spending and airline orders over the years. In 1990, jobs at Boeing accounted for 59 percent of Renton's jobs, but have since declined to 29 percent.
When Boeing started moving workers out of Renton in the early 1990s and office vacancies hit 40 percent, the city sought to escape the booms and busts of the aerospace industry. It set about streamlining its permitting process, and putting together a marketing campaign with the local chamber of commerce, technical college, medical center and school district to bring new companies to town.
It was a well-timed move. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, airplane orders plunged and Boeing laid off more than 27,000 people in the Puget Sound area. At its Renton operation, the company stopped producing the single-aisle 757 jet, focused exclusively on its popular 737 plane and consolidated employees and assembly lines. The move freed space on its 324-acre campus, allowing it to shed 46 acres. Harvest Partners eventually bought the parcel two years ago and is in negotiations to buy about 20 more acres.
''Years ago, everything was Boeing,'' said Wilma Warshak, a senior vice president at Colliers International in Tacoma. ''Today, there's so much more diversification, and we're not as dependent as we were.''
The changes in Renton extend far beyond Boeing and the shores of Lake Washington. Eleven years ago, the city moved automobile dealerships out of downtown to a site near Interstate 405 so it could redevelop the city center. Since then, a park, a regional transit center, a performing arts center, a seven-story parking garage and hundreds of apartments and condominiums have been built. Construction has begun or is planned for 412 units.
Still, the shores of Lake Washington are attracting the bulk of the attention. The Seattle Seahawks football team, owned by Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, plans to start building a 145,155-square-foot training center and headquarters -- triple the size of its site in Kirkland -- on 19 acres Mr. Allen owns.
They will have bigger workout spaces, room for up to 3,000 fans for spring training and enough space to bring all 115 employees under one roof. As it is, players sometimes have to do stretches in the locker rooms and do hurdling drills in the hallways at Kirkland, said Lance Lopes, the team's general counsel and vice president.
South of the Seahawks site, Conner Homes has broken ground for Barbee Mill, a collection of 114 luxury homes from $800,000 to about $3 million, on the site of a former lakefront sawmill. Homes will range from 2,500 to 4,000 square feet. The site is near a former creosote plant declared a Superfund site for toxic-waste cleanup last year, but Charlie Conner, president of Conner Homes, said the location was worth it.
''Where else can you build a new community on the shores of Lake Washington?'' Mr. Conner said. ''This is probably the last big piece with large square footage on the lake.''
Farther down the lake near the Boeing plant, Seco Development is renewing work on its Southport mixed-use complex and putting up 195 apartments. Michael Christ, Seco's president, mothballed work on three office towers and a 220-room hotel five years ago when the office market declined. Encouraged by the Seahawks move and the improving office market, he is looking for partners so he can go ahead with the office and hotel spaces.
''Renton is coming into its own,'' Mr. Christ said. ''Rents here are finally coming to a point where it justifies building. It feels more real than it has for a long time.''
Directing growth to Boeing's old property and downtown has had another benefit: it lets the city comply with the state's Growth Management Act without altering the character of its single-family neighborhoods. The law requires every city in the state to plan for denser growth.
Renton is not without its challenges. It has the busiest stretch of I-405 and the most congested interchange in the region. A proposed $1 billion in road improvements may relieve some of the congestion, if voters approve a gasoline tax next fall.
The Landing's construction may also be delayed. A group of residents is challenging whether city zoning rules allow it to be built, and the Westfield Group, an Australian mall developer, has joined the opposition. The company operates nearby Westfield Southcenter, which broke ground on a 400,000-square-foot expansion in May, and may compete against the Landing for tenants. The projects are expected to be completed by mid-2008 into early 2009.
But Renton is not betting solely on new projects. Boeing says it has no plans to depart. The growing number of low-fare airlines and a weak dollar have bolstered orders for the 737 and made it the company's most popular model. Through Dec. 20, Boeing sold 619 of the jetliners.
''The 737 is very much alive and well,'' said Edmund S. Greenslet, publisher of the Airline Monitor in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. ''Maybe in five to eight years from now there will be a new model, but it very likely will be built in Renton.''

Ivanka Rihtar has seen four currencies come and go in Slovenia during her lifetime. Ms. Rihtar, a 70-year-old storekeeper, has little nostalgia for any of them today.
Soon after she was born, Slovenia used occupation notes introduced during the occupation of Ljubljana by Axis forces during World War II. Next came the Yugoslav dinar, which was used for 45 years and was abandoned when Slovenia declared independence in 1991. Then, she said, Slovenes grew accustomed to using temporary tokens, issued by the government ahead of the creation of Slovenia's own currency, the tolar.
Skepticism about the euro is spreading across the E.U.’s newest member states, even though many of them once viewed adopting the currency as a badge of honor.
Ivanka Rihtar has seen four currencies come and go in Slovenia during her lifetime. Ms. Rihtar, a 70-year-old storekeeper, has little nostalgia for any of them today.
Soon after she was born, Slovenia used occupation notes introduced during the occupation of Ljubljana by Axis forces during World War II.

Then, she said, Slovenes grew accustomed to using temporary tokens, issued by the government ahead of the creation of Slovenia's own currency, the tolar.
Slovenia's adoption of the euro on Monday was one change too many for Ms. Rihtar, who works in Ljubljana's open-air fruit and vegetable market. She opposes the move, which made the former Yugoslav republic the first of the European Union's formerly Communist members to join the currency union.
''We are an independent country,'' she lamented before the switch took place. ''We should have our own currency.''
Such skepticism about the euro -- which began circulating as notes and coins just five years ago, hailed with great fanfare as an economic means to unite the Continent -- is spreading across the European Union's newest member states, even though many of them once viewed adopting the euro as a badge of honor.
None of the recent entrants, except for Slovenia, are ready to join the euro zone. Half abandoned their entry plans over the last six months, and failed to produce new timetables for joining. The lack of progress reflects persistent fiscal problems and political opposition to the tough economic changes that euro entry demands.
The newcomers have also looked on with frustration as the older members have refused to loosen the rules to take into account the budget shortfalls and higher inflation rates caused by rapid growth after shedding decades of Communist rule.
Lithuania, one of the first of the newcomers to break with communism, hoped to adopt the euro on Monday, but it failed to meet the European Union's inflation test by 0.06 of a percentage point this summer. Poland failed to muster the political consensus in favor of joining, and is threatening to hold a referendum on the issue in 2010. Hungary, burdened by political instability, has abandoned its previous target of entering the euro zone in 2010. Even Estonia, a Baltic tiger lauded for its economic prowess, has decided to move back its entry date from 2008 to 2010.
While the European Union's newcomers grapple with whether to join the euro club, those already in are having their own doubts. In Italy, France and the Netherlands, there has been a public backlash against a perceived rise in prices since the euro's introduction.
In France, Ségolène Royal, the Socialist presidential nominee, and her presumed main opponent on the right, Nicolas Sarkozy, have criticized the European Central Bank, which is responsible for setting monetary policy for the 12 countries that use the euro. Ms. Royal and Mr. Sarkozy have asserted that the bank is depressing growth by keeping interest rates too high. French officials recently suggested that countries should have a say over monetary policy, much to the annoyance of the bank, which regards its independence as sacrosanct.
Official figures suggest that fears that the euro has made things more expensive are more imagined than real, though some merchants seized on the adoption of the currency to camouflage price increases for everyday items.
Full-year inflation in euro zone countries was 2.2 percent in 2002, the year euro notes and coins were introduced, compared with 2.5 percent in 2001. Yet consumers across the euro zone complained of sudden price increases.
Such ambivalence has not gone away. Five years later, most Germans still long for their old currency, according to a recent poll by the market research firm Forsa. The poll, for Stern magazine and RTL television, showed that 58 percent of Germans would prefer the deutsche mark over the euro. In a recent survey by TNS-Sofres in France, 52 percent of those polled said giving up the franc had been ''quite bad'' or ''very bad'' for France, compared with 45 percent in 2003.
In Italy, a growing tide against the euro has led some politicians to call for the country to abandon the currency in a bid to restore Italy's sagging economic competitiveness.
In Slovenia, however, polls indicate that the euro is still generally embraced, in part because it represents a final break with the Communist past. Much of the population is already familiar with the currency from shopping trips to Austria and Italy. But pride in the country's readiness to join has been offset by fears that the euro will make life more expensive.
''I think a lot of small things are going to be more expensive,'' said Bostjan Kozina, who owns a vegetable store. ''We won't raise here because there is too much competition, and people would notice straight away. But I think small things like coffee will go up.''
To try to assuage such concerns, the government has urged retailers not to raise prices. All goods on display in Slovenia since March have been priced in euros and tolars, and the dual pricing will remain in place until June.
While Slovenians brace themselves for a change in their currency, some economists argue that the euro's successes are more symbolic than economic, and that it is misguided to push Eastern and Central European countries into joining a currency that has yet to yield the economic advantages its champions promised.
Robin Shepherd, who is a trans-Atlantic fellow of the German Marshall Fund of the United States and is based in Bratislava, said the euro had provided no obvious economic benefits to the 12 countries that use it. By contrast, in Britain, which has clung fiercely to the pound, the economy has outperformed that of the euro zone in five of the seven full years of the euro's existence. (The euro was introduced as an accounting currency in 1999, with coins and notes first distributed in 2002.)
Other critics of the euro add that the euro zone's one-size-fits-all monetary policy has proved too inflexible for countries growing at different speeds, while the euro has not managed to challenge the dollar as the world's reserve currency, though it is making gains and rose about 11 percent against the dollar in 2006.
The euro's defenders retort that the single currency has had the psychological effect of binding together the Continent, easing cross-border purchases for consumers and reducing the cost of transactions. They contend that the strict criteria for joining the euro club have motivated countries to strive for smaller budget deficits and lower inflation rates.
The discipline required for euro entry, for example, has helped Slovenia achieve steady growth of 4 percent a year, while managing to cut inflation to 2.3 percent, compared with 10 percent a decade ago.
There is a ''tendency to take the euro as a scapegoat, which is extraordinarily unjust, unfair and false,'' the European Central Bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet, recently told a committee of the European Parliament. Mr. Trichet added that the euro zone had achieved much better results in economic growth, job creation and inflation in the years since its introduction.
Whatever the economic challenges of the euro, in Slovenia, the biggest problem consumers may face is learning to handle small change. The euro will be valued at 239 tolars, a rate that has been in place since 2004 but which does not lend itself to easy mathematical conversion.
To try to help Slovenians cope, the Bank of Slovenia sentfree calculators to 760,000 households.

Before Sept. 11, 2001, SoHo seemed on the way to emerging as one of the most prestigious shopping districts in Manhattan. But after the attack on the World Trade Center, many retailers eventually left their stores after it appeared that shoppers had abandoned the district.
Now, SoHo is on the rise again, particularly among foreign clothing retailers seeking to establish stores in New York.
Many retailers left their stores after the attack on the World Trade Center, but now fashion is venturing back  though perhaps in somewhat less high-end forms.
Before Sept. 11, 2001, SoHo seemed on the way to emerging as one of the most prestigious shopping districts in Manhattan. But after the attack on the World Trade Center, many retailers eventually left their stores after it appeared that shoppers had abandoned the district.
Now, SoHo is on the rise again, particularly among foreign clothing retailers seeking to establish stores in New York.
''We're seeing this comeback,'' said Yair H. Staav, a senior managing director with the Lansco Corporation. ''It's a major vote of confidence in SoHo as a fashion location.''
Mr. Staav and another senior managing director with Lansco, Christine Emery, both retail specialists in the SoHo area, recently assisted the landlord at 92 Greene Street, a 50,000-square-foot loft condominium building under construction on a former parking lot, in two leasing transactions with foreign designers. Evisu, a Japanese jeans maker, took 3,200 square feet, and Cotélac, a French women's clothier, leased 2,500 square feet.
The asking annual rent for both spaces was about $200 a foot. ''Just two years ago, the area was dead,'' Ms. Emery said. ''Now we're seeing a return to pre-9/11 rents,'' which were about $500,000 a year for a 3,500- to 4,000-square-foot space on Greene Street.
Still, rents are affordable enough for a group of funky foreign clothing designers to set up shop in a neighborhood abandoned by many luxury designer retailers, like the British fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, H. Stern and Cartier.
The area's comeback started in 2003, when furniture designers began taking large spaces on lower Greene Street as far south as Canal Street, lured by reduced rents, brokers said. Then came an infusion of sports retailers like the sunglass designer Oakley, the surfing and snowboarding outfitter Quiksilver and the snowboarding retailer Burton.
Now fashion is venturing back -- though perhaps in somewhat less high-end forms than was there in early 2001, brokers said. Recent additions include the British designer Paul Smith, at 142 Greene Street, and the designer Karen Millen, at 112 Prince Street. AG Adriano Goldschmied, a denim designer, took space at 111 Greene Street, and Zinco, an Italian knitwear designer, has opened at 85 Mercer Street. An international women's shoe designer, Té Casan, has moved into 382 West Broadway.
The new stores' wares are not as expensive as those seen in Madison Avenue shops, said Christopher Owles, a principal at Sinvin Realty, who placed A Bathing Ape, a cult Japanese fashion label, at 91 Greene Street, in the spring of 2004.
Mr. Owles said there had been a small invasion of Japanese designers in SoHo recently. Fith, a Japanese children's clothing maker, recently leased 900 square feet at 65 West Houston Street, and Psny, a Japanese designer of fashionable baby slings, took 500 square feet of space at 69 West Houston. As of late December, a Japanese hat manufacturer was poised to lease 350 square feet at 75 West Houston, Mr. Owles said.
Besides fashion designers, foreign designers of home furnishings have also been flocking in, brokers say. Two new ones are Alessi, an Italian housewares designer, which recently opened at 130 Greene Street, near the industrial design store Moss, and Bo Concept, a Danish retail furniture chain that bills itself as an affordable home furnishing designer, at 69 Greene Street.
Bo Concept's SoHo store will be a flagship -- the chain's largest outlet, against which the success of all others will be measured -- even though the chain has had a popular store in Chelsea for almost two years, said the manager, Luis Rojas.
''A lot of people have lofts around here and open spaces, and our furniture goes well with open spaces,'' he said. ''And there are lots of furniture stores in this area, such as Natuzzi and Armani Casa.''
Still, Mr. Rojas said, the new store, open only three months, is still gauging the market. There has been a lot of tourist foot traffic, he said, almost as much, on weekends, as in Chelsea, but there has been less buying.
The asking rent for Bo Concept's almost 7,000 square feet was $385,000 a year, which works out to about $55 a foot. That rent was negotiated last spring, and since then, rents have jumped, Mr. Staav said.
Recently, a space next door, at 71 Greene Street, that is the mirror image of Bo Concept's space, was offered. It is occupied by Phi, a clothing designer led by Susan Dell, the wife of the computer maker Michael S. Dell, and the lease was offered for about $450,000 a year, Mr. Staav said, meaning that since last spring, rents have increased almost 17 percent. (Phi, which had contemplated leaving the space, has decided to stay, though no contract has been signed, brokers said.)
Robert Zeisel, who owns both 69 and 71 Greene Street, is optimistic enough to convert the space occupied by his own business, the B & Z Steel Equipment Company, across the street at 78 Greene Street, into a retail space. B & Z is one of the last operating businesses from the 1950s in what used to be an industrial neighborhood. Despite landing jobs framing SoHo's designer showrooms, Mr. Zeisel said he preferred to move his headquarters to his Brooklyn office.
Ms. Emery said the invasion of foreign designers extended to Broadway, where Uniqlo, the competitively priced Japanese clothier seeking to give stores like Gap and Banana Republic a run for their money, has moved into 546 Broadway. Last March, the company took about 50,000 square feet, including basement space, at an asking rent of $3.5 million, or roughly $70 a foot.
Foot traffic, largely driven by tourism, is crucial to SoHo's appeal for foreign retailers, which are often seeking a strong branding opportunity, brokers said. Susan Penzner of Susan Penzner Real Estate, which helped Paul Smith find his showroom, said the neighborhood was seeing a resurgence because the home furnishing and industrial design industry, which started down on Grand Street, is spreading north into more expensive storefronts.
''Greene Street is now the design street,'' she said, noting the recent opening of B&B Italia, a furniture maker, at 137 Greene Street between Prince and Houston Streets. ''There are tons of people on the weekends. And I count shopping bags -- not the people carrying only coffee cups.''

The South Korean antitrust agency has formed a task force to investigate the licensing and business practices of the wireless technology company Qualcomm, the latest in a string of legal battles for the company, officials said on Tuesday.
In Japan, Europe and the United States, Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego, faces accusations by rivals that it has abused its market dominance in wireless technology to demand excessive royalties and block fair competition.
A task force will investigate the licensing and business practices of the wireless technology company, the latest in a string of legal battles.
The South Korean antitrust agency has formed a task force to investigate the licensing and business practices of the wireless technology company Qualcomm, the latest in a string of legal battles for the company, officials said on Tuesday.
In Japan, Europe and the United States, Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego, faces accusations by rivals that it has abused its market dominance in wireless technology to demand excessive royalties and block fair competition.
Qualcomm is known for developing code-division multiple access, or CDMA, wireless technology, which is a rival standard to the global system for mobile communications, or GSM, technology. It makes money by selling chips that power cellphones, as well as collecting royalties or licensing its technology to other chip makers and cellphone manufacturers.
The creation of a task force, which is modeled after the one investigating antitrust complaints against Microsoft, means that the case in question merits a full-blown investigation, said Na Yang-ju, a spokesman for the South Korean antitrust watchdog agency, the Fair Trade Commission.
But commission officials also acknowledged that the case against Qualcomm was more complicated than they had expected. A year ago, the commission ruled that Microsoft was guilty of breaching fair trade rules, a decision the company is appealing.
''We have been investigating Qualcomm's case since last April but we have found it to be a complicated case where facts are difficult to establish,'' a commission investigator, Lee Seung-kyu, said.
South Korea is home to several leading mobile phone makers as well as smaller companies that provide technology and components. More than 80 percent of the country's 48 million people carry cellphones, all based on Qualcomm technology.
''Companies here have constantly complained about Qualcomm demanding too much royalty,'' said Kevin Lee, an industry analyst at Woori Investment and Securities in Seoul.
''The investigation can be seen as political pressure on Qualcomm to be more friendly toward South Korean companies which use its technology,'' Mr. Lee added.
Executives at the company said they had no comment because they had not yet received official queries from the Fair Trade Commission.
Investigators from the commission searched Qualcomm Korea's two offices in April, seeking data on Qualcomm's business dealings with Samsung, LG and Pantech.
Qualcomm Korea said it was standing by a statement issued in April by its parent that its ''business practices are lawful and procompetitive.''
The investigation into Qualcomm was set off last year by complaints from Nextreaming and Thin Multimedia, two South Korean companies that make software that allows cellphone users to download music, surf the Internet and display video over high-speed cellular networks.
Lim Il-tiek, president of Nextreaming, accused Qualcomm of undermining fair competition by bundling its multimedia software into its market-dominant cellphone chip sets.
Correction:  January 5, 2007, Friday  An article in Business Day on Wednesday about an investigation of Qualcomm by the antitrust authorities in South Korea misspelled the given name of the president of Nextreaming, which has accused Qualcomm of undermining fair competition. It is Lim Il-taek, not Lim Il-tiek.

A government effort to cool Ireland's roaring economy by encouraging people to save is threatening to backfire.
In 2001, Ireland encouraged citizens to set money aside each month in special accounts by offering to match a portion of those savings. The catch was that savers had to lock up their money for five years.
A government effort to cool Ireland’s roaring economy by encouraging people to save is threatening to backfire.
A government effort to cool Ireland's roaring economy by encouraging people to save is threatening to backfire.
In 2001, Ireland encouraged citizens to set money aside each month in special accounts by offering to match a portion of those savings. The catch was that savers had to lock up their money for five years.
About 1.1 million Irish savers -- or 40 percent of the adult population -- amassed 16 billion euros ($21 billion) in savings, a sum that is about 10 percent of the country's annual gross domestic product.
But now that the five years are over, the wealth is being unleashed, and the plan may do exactly what it was meant to prevent: add fuel to the economy of one of the most competitive and fastest-growing countries in Europe.
The expected outcome underscores the trickiness in taming surging economies -- a task that the authorities in China are grappling with. It could also serve as a case study for countries, like the United States, which are looking for ways to motivate spendthrift consumers to save more to rebalance their economies.
Edel Byrne, 30, an operations director for a large chain of restaurants in Dublin, is looking forward to spending the 20,000 euros she will have accumulated when the five-year lockup ends in the spring. She has her eyes on a Marni handbag -- the line sells on the Internet for 280 to 1,060 euros -- and airline tickets to Rio de Janeiro, Milan and Paris. She plans to spend some of what is left on a house that she recently bought in the Dublin suburbs.
In 2002, Ms. Byrne would never have dreamed of setting aside as much as 254 euros each month for five years if the government had not made it worth her while: It gave her one euro for every four she paid into her so-called Special Savings Incentive Account, or S.S.I.A.
For Ms. Byrne, the government incentive was worth 63.50 euros each month. Her own monthly payments, the government bonus and the interest she earned were not accessible as the savings accumulated.
Some of the accounts have already matured since the program opened in May 2001. But most savers, who on average have accumulated 15,000 euros, according to industry estimates, delayed opening the accounts until the months before enrollment ended in April 2002.
The freed savings will come on top of an estimated 5 billion euros in increased public spending and tax cuts that the Irish government plans to pump into the economy in 2007, an election year.
If the Irish choose to spend their savings over a few months rather than tap the personal wealth pool over two or three years, inflation, especially for services like hotels and restaurants, could accelerate at a time when prices are already rising rapidly.
''The 16 billion euros is a phenomenal amount of money,'' said Jim Power, chief economist at Friends First, a pension and investment firm in Dublin. ''There is of course an inflationary risk. There is already an inflationary risk notwithstanding the S.S.I.A. effect.''
The savings plan was devised by Charlie McCreevy, the Irish finance minister at the time and now the European Union's commissioner for the internal market, who wanted to tame a potential threat of inflation to the Irish economy.
In 2000, consumer prices in Ireland rose 5.6 percent. That figure had moderated to 2.5 percent for 2005, but it started creeping up again in 2006, to a 4.4 percent pace in November, and is expected to stay relatively high at about 3.5 percent in 2007, according to some economists who fear the bounty from the savings accounts could inject too much money into the economy over a short period.
But nobody really knows what will happen, which is why there have been widespread surveys of the intentions of savers like Ms. Byrne.
Banks eager to hold on to the large sums are offering new but less generous saving products. Savers whose special accounts have already matured appear to be taking their time in deciding what to do with the money.
Similar savings plans by other European governments have not been as popular, probably because the cash incentives were much less generous than those offered by the Irish plan. In Britain, for example, tax-efficient savings plans like Individual Savings Accounts, or I.S.A.'s, operate through the tax system rather than with cash incentives.
Consumer spending in Ireland is less than 50 percent of gross domestic product, low by European standards, according to Dan McLaughlin, chief economist at Bank of Ireland. According to the Irish Central Statistics Office, the country had a household savings rate of 11.9 percent of income in 2003, compared with 2.1 percent in the United States and 11.1 percent in France.
On Grafton Street, one of central Dublin's main shopping streets, evidence of the usual seasonal surge in spending has not been hard to detect. But whether spending will be further fueled as Irish consumers anticipate tapping their savings is difficult to judge, said Stephen Sealey, a buying director for the department store Brown Thomas. It sells Hermès handbags for as much as 10,000 euros ($13,200) and Chanel watches for 7,500 euros ($9,940).
''Over the last four years, we have seen a steady growth in luxury goods,'' he said, adding that buoyant consumer spending ''is driving double-digit year-on-year growth across the business.''
Mr. McLaughlin, at Bank of Ireland, said that surveys by his bank indicated that a slice of the special accounts would be spent on foreign holidays and home renovations. He forecast that spending from the accounts would help support the economy over the next three or four years at a time when rising interest rates are adding to the costs of housing.
But if Ms. Byrne is any indication, not all the money will be spent.
''The Irish are good at treating themselves these days, but I would feel guilty to spend over half the amount on luxuries,'' she said. ''I do not think you should just throw away five years of hard savings.''

One of the big winners in the last election may turn out to be the principle, known as net neutrality, that Internet service providers should not be able to favor some content over others. Democrats who are moving into the majority in Congress -- led by Ron Wyden in the Senate and Edward Markey in the House -- say they plan to fight hard to pass a net neutrality bill, and we hope that they do. It is vital to preserve the Internet's role in promoting entrepreneurship and free expression.
Internet users now get access to any Web site on an equal basis. Foreign and domestic sites, big corporate home pages and little-guy blogs all show up on a user's screen in the same way when their addresses are typed into a browser. Anyone who puts up a Web page can broadcast it to the world.

Cable and telephone companies are talking, however, about creating a two-tiered Internet with a fast lane and a slow lane. Companies that pay hefty fees would have their Web pages delivered to Internet users in the current speedy fashion. Companies and individuals that do not would be relegated to the slow lane.
Creating these sorts of tiers would destroy the democratic quality of the Internet. Big, wealthy voices would start to overpower the smaller, poorer ones. Innovation would be threatened if start-ups and small companies could not afford the new fees. The next eBay or Google might never be born.
A net neutrality law would require cable and telephone companies to continue to provide Web sites to Internet users on an equal basis. Mr. Markey, of Massachusetts, will be taking over a key subcommittee that handles Internet issues. He has promised to hold hearings to educate Congress and the public, and to reintroduce his strong net neutrality bill. Mr. Wyden, of Oregon, plans to reintroduce an equally solid bill in the Senate.
Passing the legislation will not be easy. The cable and telephone companies have fought net neutrality with a lavishly financed and misleading lobbying campaign, because they stand to gain an enormous windfall. But there is growing support from individuals and groups across the political spectrum, from MoveOn.org to the Gun Owners of America, who worry about what will happen to their free speech if Internet service providers are allowed to pick and choose the traffic they carry.
In the last week, there was a limited but important victory for net neutrality. As a condition of approving the AT&T-BellSouth merger, the Federal Communications Commission required AT&T to guarantee net neutrality on its broadband service for the next two years. The commission was right to extract this concession, but it should not be necessary to negotiate separate deals like this one. On the information superhighway, net neutrality should be a basic rule of the road.

The mood at Eliot Spitzer's Jan. 1 inauguration was exuberant, and that was hardly surprising. Few politicians are offered the opportunity that greets Mr. Spitzer as he becomes New York's 54th governor.
Mr. Spitzer, who has built his career on reform, is arriving in a state capital that desperately needs it. The comptroller was forced to resign after pleading guilty to a felony. The Senate majority leader is being investigated by the F.B.I. for his outside consulting work. Another state senator is charged with stealing state money, and it took a state judge to force legislators to reveal how they spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year in taxpayer money.
In Gov. Eliot Spitzer, we see a figure poised to rattle Albany’s do-little establishment, to air out a dark, closed government and to try to convert New York’s Legislature to the higher purposes of public service.
The mood at Eliot Spitzer's Jan. 1 inauguration was exuberant, and that was hardly surprising. Few politicians are offered the opportunity that greets Mr. Spitzer as he becomes New York's 54th governor.
Mr. Spitzer, who has built his career on reform, is arriving in a state capital that desperately needs it. The comptroller was forced to resign after pleading guilty to a felony. The Senate majority leader is being investigated by the F.B.I. for his outside consulting work. Another state senator is charged with stealing state money, and it took a state judge to force legislators to reveal how they spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year in taxpayer money.
New York's government has slipped from a beacon for other states into a cautionary tale. So when Mr. Spitzer spoke of change in his inaugural address -- an end to government ''that works for those who hold office, not those who put them there'' -- he hit precisely the right note. With a passion and energy that Albany has not seen in years, this governor has promised to wake what he has labeled the ''Rip van Winkle'' government of the last decade.
Mr. Spitzer started on the right foot by issuing five executive orders to upgrade the ethics of the executive branch with rules that should go without saying, but in Albany never do -- like not using state property or personnel for personal use, and not taking gifts from people who do business with the state.
By cleaning his own house first, Mr. Spitzer will have the moral high ground as he does battle to get New York's recalcitrant lawmakers to do the same. After years of mostly dozing off, they require a long list: redistricting reform, campaign finance reform, ethics reform, and budget reform, including more sunlight on how $114 billion a year is being spent.
Getting reform through the Legislature will be hard enough, but Mr. Spitzer faces equally tough challenges in dealing with budget deficits and education needs and keeping the state's high taxes in check. In his inaugural address, he pointedly said that he does not believe in ''government as a heavy hand that can cure all our ills,'' a sign that some of his Democratic allies might not have as much clout as they are expecting.
Mr. Spitzer began setting his new tone on day one, with his ''people's inauguration.'' The official swearing-in was outdoors, public invited. He threw open the governor's mansion for the first time since most people waiting in line could remember. Instead of a fancy ball for fat-cat contributors, he spent the night of his inauguration at a free concert by James Taylor and other crowd favorites.
For the first time in years, we see a figure poised to rattle Albany's do-little establishment, to air out a dark, closed government and to try to convert New York's Legislature to the higher purposes of public service. New Yorkers can only hope Mr. Spitzer makes it all happen.

A year after Russia put the gas squeeze on Ukraine, it was Belarus's turn. Unlike Ukraine, Belarus blinked two minutes before the Jan. 1 deadline and Russia had its booty: a 50 percent share of Belarus's pipeline network and a more than doubling of the price Belarus will now pay for Russian gas.
There was no global outcry this time. President Aleksandr Lukashenko, the utterly Soviet boss of Belarus, has no friends in the West. But this latest squeeze is another warning that the Kremlin will let nothing -- personal loyalty, contracts, the law -- halt its drive to reimpose state control on Russia's energy sector. It is also another reminder that the West, a big consumer of Russian energy, remains vulnerable to President Vladimir Putin's whims.

It is also another reminder that the West, a big consumer of Russian energy, remains vulnerable to President Vladimir Putin's whims.
The Belarus deal came less than two weeks after Royal Dutch Shell gave in to the Kremlin's pressure and sold a controlling share in the Sakhalin-2 oil and gas project to Gazprom, Russia's state gas monopoly. Moscow is now leaning on the British-Russian joint venture, TNK-BP, to give Gazprom a large and possibly controlling stake.
A year ago, when the democratic revolutions in Georgia and Ukraine were seen as serious threats to the Kremlin's influence, Mr. Putin was eager to prop up Mr. Lukashenko. But once Mr. Lukashenko successfully stole the March presidential election, the new gas bill arrived in Minsk. That included half ownership for the Kremlin of Beltransgaz, the state pipeline operator that not only fuels Belarus but also supplies a fifth of Europe's gas.
Russia's European customers could increase their leverage -- and possibly improve the Kremlin's behavior -- if they negotiated jointly with Gazprom, rather than scurrying to cut separate deals. Western companies and governments also need to warn Moscow that its leverage has limits. Russia will need the expertise and capital of foreign companies if it wants to keep developing its natural resources. No one wants to do business with a bully.

Congress recently responded by extending the tax deduction for families' tuition expenses, and New York's private colleges and universities have made a fourfold increase in grants, to more than $2 billion annually, since 1990. Yet New York State's tuition-assistance program raised its top student-aid levels by just 21 percent over that time period. For the last five years, neither that program nor the federal Pell grant program has raised top awards at all.

The announcement that our 3,000th service member had made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq came while Americans were popping Champagne corks and reveling in Times Square and elsewhere throughout our country. How surreal!
The grim milestone occurred almost 20 days after our president announced that he was ''not going to be rushed'' into a new strategy for Iraq and some 70 American fatalities later. How tragic!
At this rate and with this administration's mind-set, Americans will be mourning another 1,000 deaths, and parents, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters will be shedding countless more tears in another 12 months.
How pathetic and, yes, how preventable!

Thank you for publishing ''The Roster of the Dead'' (Jan. 1) -- pictures of the third thousand United States service members killed in Iraq -- putting names and faces on what are otherwise nonembodied statistics.
These are statistics that the Bush administration chooses to play down, much less honor by not even allowing photographs of their coffins as they arrive in the United States.
We need to be reminded more often -- monthly? weekly? -- of the sacrifice that these, America's most sacred and valuable treasure, are making in a war that lacks foreseeable end and valid purpose, if it ever really had one.

How many more milestones must be reached for this president and his administration to realize the human suffering he has caused in pursuit of an unattainable goal?
The faces of the dead soldiers are a horrible reminder not only of the pain and destruction of their families and friends, but also of those many others who have been maimed and emotionally destroyed on both the American and Iraqi sides.
And still there is no end in sight while the rich in this country get richer and the power brokers ignore the inequality of the cost of this war.
The chain reaction of events throughout this whole fiasco will only continue to cause further deaths and injuries while President Bush and his cabinet continue to take their vacations and their sweet time in bringing this to an end.

Re ''U.S. Questioned Iraq on the Rush to Hang Hussein'' (front page, Jan. 1):
Excuse me if I am skeptical of the claim that American officials in Iraq questioned the rush to hang Saddam Hussein.
Like so much this administration has done to discredit the principles and values of our country, this claim rings hollow.
The very words used in the article to describe our goals in the intervention -- ''legal workarounds'' and ''legal mechanisms'' -- reflect this administration's contempt for what most of us consider the principles of justice.
We can't indefinitely try to have it both ways: acting like a brutal dictator of the world while professing our virtue.

To the Editor:
It is interesting and revealing that after orchestrating the show trial that culminated in the execution of Saddam Hussein, the Bush administration now seeks to distance itself from the disgraceful, lawless proceedings leading up to the execution and to disavow responsibility for the ugly, vindictive spectacle in the death chamber (''U.S. Questioned Iraq on the Rush to Hang Hussein,'' front page, Jan. 1).
The repulsive videotape of Saddam Hussein's death, however, clearly represents the Bush-Maliki concept of justice in action.

To the Editor:
Re ''Feared and Pitiless; Fearful and Pitiable'' (Week in Review, Dec. 31):
It is a pity that the noose around Saddam Hussein's neck will be an albatross around the United States' neck for a long time to come.
The execution was done hurriedly in a country still under occupation, and the trial that led to it had many missteps, as acknowledged by several international authorities around the world.
It is another milestone in the dismal handling of the whole Iraq war by George W. Bush and his administration.
Sevgin Oktay  Poughkeepsie, N.Y.  Dec. 31, 2006
To the Editor:
Re ''What Did Hussein's Execution Accomplish?'' (letters, Jan. 1):
I read through the 11 letters, most of which opposed the execution (asserting that the trial was unfair or opposing capital punishment).
None, not even the few that conceded Saddam Hussein's guilt, mention one overwhelming reason for executing him.
Let's say the alternative was to give him a life sentence. Soon, a fragile Iraqi government might succumb to pressure and ''commute'' his sentence, even free him.
Then, he reorganizes his Tikrit gangsters and Baath Party and stages a comeback. Or his followers could achieve a jailbreak. Far-fetched? Napoleon did it.
No, a living Saddam Hussein was too dangerous. I also think that the Iraqi court trial was fair; the evidence showed that Saddam Hussein was a mass murderer, and the verdict is a victory for human rights law.

To the Editor:
I commend your Dec. 9 editorial ''The Agonies of Zimbabwe,'' which cited Robert Mugabe's misrule as responsible for the suffering of the Zimbabwe people. The regime has impoverished Zimbabweans and suppressed their democratic aspirations.
I wish to clarify the nature of United States sanctions. They are not aimed at the general economy, but are targeted at the members of the Mugabe government and others who have undermined the democratic processes.
American companies are free to do business with Zimbabwe companies not connected with government officials and others who have crippled the country's democracy. United States policy helps shield the Zimbabwe people by offering humanitarian aid. Over the last four years, we have provided nearly $350 million in food assistance and help combating H.I.V./AIDS.
Zimbabwe's plight is desperate, and the United States is committed to helping this country regain what it has lost. We look forward to helping a post-Mugabe government take up the reforms that are needed to put it back on the path to a free-market democracy.

Britain's deputy prime minister said Tuesday that the taunting and baiting that accompanied Saddam Hussein's execution was unacceptable and that the people responsible should be condemned for taking part.
''I think the manner was quite deplorable, really,'' said the deputy prime minister, John Prescott. ''I don't think one can endorse in any way that, whatever your views about capital punishment.''
Britain’s deputy prime minister, John Prescott, said that the people responsible should be condemned for taking part, but he refused to be drawn into criticizing the Iraqi government.
Britain's deputy prime minister said Tuesday that the taunting and baiting that accompanied Saddam Hussein's execution was unacceptable and that the people responsible should be condemned for taking part.
''I think the manner was quite deplorable, really,'' said the deputy prime minister, John Prescott. ''I don't think one can endorse in any way that, whatever your views about capital punishment.''
Responding to the murky scenes that emerged after the execution showing witnesses and guards chanting and telling Saddam to ''go to hell'' as his executioners prepared to hang him, Mr. Prescott added: ''Frankly, to get that kind of recorded messages coming out is totally unacceptable, and I think whoever is involved and responsible for it should be ashamed of themselves.''
But in a terse exchange with an interviewer on BBC radio, Mr. Prescott refused to be drawn into criticizing the Iraqi government, which had custody of Mr. Hussein and which arranged his execution. ''If they are responsible, I pass my comment and that's where I stand,'' he said.
Images of Mr. Hussein with a noose around his neck have been plastered across newspapers and shown on television all weekend here. In a country implacably opposed to the death penalty, the sight has been shocking, as was the speed with which it was carried out.
Prime Minister Tony Blair, on vacation in Florida, has not spoken publicly about Mr. Hussein's death, an omission that has been seized on by antiwar members of his Labor Party as another misstep in a long succession of them on Iraq. But the foreign secretary, Margaret Beckett, released a statement last week saying that while she welcomed the fact that Saddam had been tried and ''held to account,'' the British government had made it clear that it opposed the death penalty.
''We have made our position very clear to the Iraqi authorities, but we respect their decision as that of a sovereign nation,'' she said. Asked if the government had also complained to the Iraqis about how the execution was carried out, Mr. Prescott repeated what Ms. Beckett had said.

On his first day of work as secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, the mild-spoken South Korean diplomat who had suggested he would bring new caution to the post, invited controversy by declining to criticize the death penalty applied to Saddam Hussein.
Mr. Ban commented on the execution of Mr. Hussein just after entering United Nations headquarters on Tuesday morning to start his job.
Ban Ki-moon, on his first day as secretary general, appeared to contradict United Nations policy opposing the death penalty.
On his first day of work as secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, the mild-spoken South Korean diplomat who had suggested he would bring new caution to the post, invited controversy by declining to criticize the death penalty applied to Saddam Hussein.
Mr. Ban commented on the execution of Mr. Hussein just after entering United Nations headquarters on Tuesday morning to start his job.
''Saddam Hussein was responsible for committing heinous crimes and unspeakable atrocities against the Iraqi people,'' Mr. Ban said in response to questions from a crush of reporters outside the Security Council's chambers. ''We should never forget the victims of his crimes, '' he said.
''The issue of capital punishment is for each and every member state to decide,'' he added.
''While I am firmly against impunity, I also hope the members of the international community should pay due regard to all aspects of international humanitarian laws.''
Mr. Ban's remarks appeared to contradict bedrock United Nations policy opposing the death penalty on human rights grounds.
He seemed to have tripped in his effort to tread lightly on the political views of the many United Nations members.
The remarks also seemed to show that Mr. Ban, who was South Korea's foreign minister when he was chosen in October as secretary general, had not completed the transition from representing his country to leading the United Nations.
Michèle Montas, Mr. Ban's spokeswoman, said the death penalty was legal in South Korea.
On Dec. 30, hours after Mr. Hussein was hanged, the United Nations special representative for Iraq, Ashraf Qazi, said in Baghdad that although the United Nations ''understands the desire for justice felt by many Iraqis,'' it could not support the execution.
''Based on the principle of respect for the right to life,'' Mr. Qazi said, ''the United Nations remains opposed to capital punishment, even in the case of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.''
Ms. Montas, whose first day on the job also was Tuesday, said Mr. Ban had not intended to change United Nations policy, but had added his own ''nuance.'' Mr. Hussein was hanged in a hasty execution at dawn on Dec. 30, in a chamber where many Iraqis had been killed under his brutal rule.
In public comments before his first meeting with United Nations staff, Mr. Ban said, ''We have to show the international community that we are ready and eager to change.'' He said the organization had faced ''harsh and sometimes unfair criticism,'' and acknowledged that ''staff morale has plummeted.'' But he said United Nations workers must be ready to ''multitask'' and to move frequently from armchair jobs at headquarters in New York into the field.
''My watchword will be meritocracy,'' he said, in words that should be well received by the Bush administration, which backed Mr. Ban to succeed Kofi Annan, who served two five-year terms, in part because of Mr. Ban's pledges to streamline the United Nations bureaucracy.
In veiled words, Mr. Ban seemed to hint that he would not overreach his power, but that he expected cooperation from the United States. Speaking of the many crises facing the organization, he said, ''Not a single person, including the secretary general of the United Nations; not a single country, however strong, powerful, resourceful, maybe, can address this.''

Last Saturday was a strange day. It started with the hanging of Saddam Hussein. The more I read about the hasty, quasi-legal maneuvers used by Iraq's Shiite leaders to rush Saddam to the gallows on a Muslim holiday, Id al-Adha, and the more I watched the grainy cellphone video of the event, in which a guard is heard taunting Saddam with chants of ''Moktada! Moktada!'' -- the Shiite cleric whose death squads have killed hundreds of Sunnis -- and the more I read of the insults Saddam spat back, the more it resembled a tribal revenge ritual rather than the culmination of a constitutional process in which America should be proud to have participated.
Bassam al-Husseini, an aide to Iraq's Shiite prime minister, was quoted by the BBC as saying Saddam's execution was ''an Id gift to the Iraqi people.'' Many Sunnis would not share that view. For his part, Saddam, a Sunni, used his last breaths to spew vitriol against ''the traitors, the Americans, the spies and the Persians.'' For Persians, read Shiites.
As Saddam’s hanging underscored, Iraqis are doing things their way. So maybe it’s time to get out of their way.

For his part, Saddam, a Sunni, used his last breaths to spew vitriol against ''the traitors, the Americans, the spies and the Persians.'' For Persians, read Shiites.
No wonder the BBC's world affairs editor, John Simpson, reported from Baghdad: ''Altogether, the execution as we now see it is shown to be an ugly, degrading business, which is more reminiscent of a public hanging in the 18th century than a considered act of 21st-century official justice. Under Saddam Hussein, prisoners were regularly taunted and mistreated in their last hours. The most disturbing thing about the new video of Saddam's execution for crimes precisely like this is that it is all much too reminiscent of what used to happen here.''
But as I said, Saturday was a strange day. After watching Saddam's hanging in the morning, I was sitting at my computer late in the afternoon and suddenly heard the strains of ''My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty'' being played on the TV in the next room. When I checked what was going on, I saw President Ford's coffin being unloaded from Air Force One.
I have to admit I got a lump in my throat watching that scene and listening to that stirring melody. Saddam's execution was a snapshot of a country divided. Gerald Ford's funeral was a snapshot of a country united -- political supporters and opponents alike paying tribute to a president, who was surrounded by an honor guard representing every color of the American rainbow and whose place in history was secured by an act of pardon and national healing.
How fortunate to live in a country where this is the political norm, built up over generations.
''Because of our basic unity, we can afford to be divided on specific issues,'' said Michael Mandelbaum, author of ''The Case for Goliath.'' ''Democracy is about differences and contesting them in the public sphere, and it only works when there is basic agreement about the fundamentals. We should feel fortunate that we have a democratic history and set of beliefs. Those beliefs can be imported by those who want them and don't have them, but they can't be exported. We can only create a context where others would want to import them.''
The raw tribal theatrics of Saddam's hanging highlight just how few of these values Iraq has imported. We are to blame for not creating the security needed for those values to take hold. But not enough of our Iraqi allies have risen to the occasion, either. It was our closest Iraqi partners who oversaw Saddam's tribal hanging. We have to look that in the eye.
Saddam deserved to die 100 deaths. But imagine if Iraq's Shiite leaders had surprised everyone, declared that there had been enough killing in Iraq and commuted Saddam's sentence to life in prison -- sparing his life in hopes of uniting the country rather than executing him and dividing it further. I don't know if it would have helped, but I do know Iraqis have rarely surprised us with gestures of reconciliation -- only with new ways to kill each other.
Now President Bush wants a ''surge'' of more U.S. troops to Baghdad, in one last attempt to bring order. Whenever I hear this surge idea, I think of a couple who recently got married but the marriage was never very solid. Then one day they say to each other, ''Hey, let's have a baby, that will bring us together.'' It never works.
If the underlying union is not there, adding a baby won't help. And if the underlying willingness to share power and resources is not present among the major communities in Iraq, adding more U.S. troops won't help either. Adding more troops makes sense only if it's to buy more time for positive trends that have already begun to appear on the horizon. I don't see them.
As Saddam's hanging underscored, Iraqis are doing things their way. So maybe it's time to get out of their way.

WHEN the new Congress begins its session tomorrow, two familiar faces will not be present: Senator Paul S. Sarbanes and Representative Michael G. Oxley, who are both retiring. Mr. Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat, has served for 30 years; Mr. Oxley, an Ohio Republican, for 26 -- and their main legacy will be their joint attack on corporate corruption, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
The act, which was passed hastily in the wake of the Enron scandal, was surely well intentioned. But it has proven counterproductive in the extreme, and Congress would best honor the departing lawmakers by repealing it.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act has seriously harmed American corporations and financial markets without increasing investor confidence.

Mr. Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat, has served for 30 years; Mr. Oxley, an Ohio Republican, for 26 -- and their main legacy will be their joint attack on corporate corruption, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
The act, which was passed hastily in the wake of the Enron scandal, was surely well intentioned. But it has proven counterproductive in the extreme, and Congress would best honor the departing lawmakers by repealing it.
Sarbanes-Oxley has seriously harmed American corporations and financial markets without increasing investor confidence. The section of the law requiring companies to perform internal audits has turned out to be far more costly than proponents projected, especially for smaller firms. These costs have led some small companies to go private, hardly a victory for public oversight, and some foreign firms to withdraw their stocks from American exchanges.
In addition, the average ''listing premium'' -- the benefit that companies receive by listing their stocks on American exchanges -- has declined by 19 percentage points since 2002. This explains why the percentage of worldwide initial public offerings on our exchanges dropped to 5 percent last year, from 50 percent in 2000.
Other costs associated with the act may turn out to be more important. For example, more stringent financial regulations and increased penalties for accounting errors may make senior managers too risk-averse. Most chief executives are not accountants, so the requirement that they personally affirm tax reports -- at the risk of jail time should anything be amiss -- may make them reluctant to partake in perfectly legitimate activities.
Paradoxically, Sarbanes-Oxley's strict rules on oversight by boards of directors would have been insufficient to prevent the collapse of Enron. By the act's standards, Enron had a model board; most members were distinguished professionals. The chairman of the audit committee was a former accounting professor and dean of the Stanford Business School.
Nor would the act's provisions to create a stronger Securities and Exchange Commission have made a difference. The commission had been aware of Enron's accounting techniques since 1992 and had never thought to question them.
Nor was Sarbanes-Oxley necessary in prosecuting the senior managers of Enron, WorldCom and other corporations where fraud was committed -- all have been convicted of accounting fraud under laws predating the act.
The negative repercussions of the act on businesses might have been worth it if the act had achieved its primary goal: substantially increasing the confidence of investors in the accuracy of the accounts of firms listed on the exchanges. But that does not seem to have happened.
The best measure of investor confidence is the price-earnings ratio -- the price that investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company's reported earnings. The overall price-earnings ratio for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, however, has declined continuously since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was being drafted in the spring of 2002.
Several leaders of the new Democratic Congressional majority have endorsed a relaxation of the audit requirements and other parts of the act. That is encouraging, but it is not enough. The basic structure of Sarbanes-Oxley is unsound.
One big problem is that the act nationalized the rules for corporate governance, reducing the value of the competition among the states for setting such rules. In addition, the act failed to resolve the major conflict of interest created when auditing firms are paid by the companies they audit. Rather than creating a regulation to change the system, Sarbanes-Oxley created an expensive and arguably unconstitutional new regulatory agency to regulate the audit firms' activities.
And, as is too often the case, Congress has rewarded the failures of the very bureaucracies that failed to keep up with Enron -- doubling the budget of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Tinkering is not enough. Sarbanes-Oxley continues to discourage smaller companies from trading publicly and foreign companies from listing their stocks on American exchanges. In the eyes of investors, it hasn't cleaned up any corruption, it has only forced companies to jump through hoops. As Senator Sarbanes and Representative Oxley drift into retirement, their act should retire with them.

141 <html><head><b><center>A Brooklyn Furrier and Artist Finds Soul Mates Among the Indians of the West<center></b></head><p align="left">Profile of Brooklyn furrier Irving Feller; Feller has been involved with American Indians since 1972 when Bureau of Indian Affairs asked him to teach Indians fur business; photo (M)
Even in a city full of talented people with eclectic interests, Irving Feller's combination of work and obsession stands out. Mr. Feller is a furrier by trade and an abstract artist out of love.
He can make a sumptuous fur coat from scratch as easily as he can create jarring works of pattern and color. And both pursuits are informed by his passion for American Indian culture. All this has transformed his family's fur business, started in 1916 by his father, into an unexpected preserve of one man's vision.

All this has transformed his family's fur business, started in 1916 by his father, into an unexpected preserve of one man's vision.
Among the furs, paired with Mardi Gras beads draping the window's mannequin to celebrate the new year, are a trove of artifacts: turquoise rings, a feathered headdress labeled ''Child's War Bonnet'' and hand-sewn baby moccasins.
''Come on in,'' Mr. Feller, 78, calls out, welcoming a visitor to the Manhattan Furrier at 685 Manhattan Avenue, a bustling street in the once Polish and now hipster enclave of Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Two deer heads with gentle eyes and velveteen antlers hang above the entrance. From the ceiling and walls hang hundreds of pelts, mink stoles, sables and sheared beaver, to name a few.
Underneath a chandelier of raccoon tails, Mr. Feller's wife, Selma, is wrapped in a parka, her chair resting on a bull skin. Fanning her long fingers, she shrugged, ''I could have any fur I want.''
In one corner is a painting of a clown, sketched in blue pencil from Mr. Feller's figurative period. There are many canvases riddled with an intricate black and white geometric maze drawn in Magic Marker, Mr. Feller's favorite medium.
''I was drawing the human face for a long time,'' he said. ''Somehow, these forms mean more to me now than the face.''
Mr. Feller's store is a work of art. Years ago, he spray-painted the walls gold, which, depending on one's viewpoint, looks like fur or an abstract design. Also hanging on the walls are the Ten Commandments and yellowed news clippings of Mr. Feller wearing a headdress on a visit to a reservation. A chart of Indian chiefs identifies them by name in Polish. It is hung opposite a poster once issued by McDonald's depicting the faces of black history.
''I am already an old man and we are going to live a certain amount of time,'' Mr. Feller said. ''Human nature is we're animals. I'll come out and tell you just what I'm thinking.''
In his dim workshop, his blackened sewing machines rest, awaiting a big beaver coat for a Botero-proportioned customer. A huge portrait of Selma hangs over his worktable.
Mr. Feller was born and raised in Astoria, Queens, where his father had immigrated at 14 from Ukraine in the early 1900s and later started a fur business. Mr. Feller's grandfather had immigrated from Ukraine after abandoning Mr. Feller's father and his grandmother, who ran a small candy stand. ''My father became a terrific furrier, nailing, cutting, matching, operating,'' Mr. Feller said.
In World War II, Mr. Feller served as an artist for the Army, creating original silk-screened posters that described treatments for syphilis and gonorrhea. One poster showed a woman lifting her skirt, reading, ''Is it worth it?''
After the war, he said, the government paid for art studies at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Then he went to Jerusalem, where he worked as a portraitist in the King David Citadel Hotel. When he returned home, Mr. Feller took up the family business.
Relating his life history like a fable, he told of one key event after another. ''I went to the Catskills, telling the bus driver to take me to the Borscht Belt's highest mountain. There I found my Selma.''
Selma, 81, grew up on the Lower East Side, the daughter of a Polish father and Austrian mother. The Fellers have a daughter, a teacher at Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts in Manhattan.
In the back of Mr. Feller's store is an huge safe filled with fragrant furs. ''But I see myself as an artist first,'' he said.
Thirty-five years ago Mr. Feller was sitting at his desk, drawing one of his colorful abstract patterns, when the phone rang. The voice on the other end introduced himself as Bill Christensen of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. ''He said: 'We'd like you to help the Indians go into the fur business. I'm sending you a ticket to fly out to Fort Hall, Idaho,' '' Mr. Feller recalled.
No ticket arrived. Mr. Feller called Mr. Christensen but was told that the bureau had run out of money. ''I already told Selma, 'I'm going to the Native Americans, they need me,' '' he said. ''I'd never been west of the Hudson, but I was blessed with a little blue Chevy.''
Mr. Feller drove hundreds of miles along the Canadian border and wound up near Bonner's Ferry, Idaho. ''They'll kill you, they have wild dogs, they'll bury you on the reservation, I was warned,'' he said. ''Finally, I saw little houses in a circle. The chief was a woman, and the dogs came out and licked my hands.''
Every year Mr. Feller visits the Kutenai tribe and the Shoshone-Bannock in southern Idaho, the Crow and the Nez Perce in Montana and Wyoming and the Apache, Navajo, Zuni and Hopi in Arizona and New Mexico. He sells them skins from animals they no longer trap and he buys jewelry from them to sell in his Greenpoint shop.
Mr. Feller compared many American Indians on reservations to the concentration camp victims he met in Paris after the war. Many were removed from their original sites, and their way of life was nearly destroyed. But in them Mr. Feller discovered what he calls ''honor'' and artistic vision.
''They use their eyes,'' he said. ''Be quiet. The less you say the better.'' As if to wrap things up about his relationship with the Indians and his view of his own life, he added: ''The underdog. Always go for the underdog.''

The last time James E. McGreevey was inside the governor's office, his name was painted on the glass door.
But early Tuesday, when most employees were beginning to trickle into the Capitol from the New Year's Day holiday, Mr. McGreevey had already arrived -- his first visit since his resignation in November 2004 -- for a ceremony to mark his legacy in another way: with the hanging of his official portrait.
James E. McGreevey made his first visit to New Jersey’s Capitol since his resignation in November 2004 for the hanging of his official gubernatorial portrait.
The last time James E. McGreevey was inside the governor's office, his name was painted on the glass door.
But early Tuesday, when most employees were beginning to trickle into the Capitol from the New Year's Day holiday, Mr. McGreevey had already arrived -- his first visit since his resignation in November 2004 -- for a ceremony to mark his legacy in another way: with the hanging of his official portrait.
The unveiling, which was unannounced and closed to the public, was less a ceremony than it was a private gathering of Mr. McGreevey, his parents, a couple of former aides, his partner, Mark O'Donnell, and Gov. Jon S. Corzine. It was a far more muted affair than the release of the ex-governor's book, ''The Confession,'' in September, when he appeared on ''Oprah,'' ''Larry King Live'' and at numerous book signings.
The portrait, by the artist Chen Yanning, now hangs on the far wall of the governor's outer office, along with about a half-dozen others. This is the same room where Mr. McGreevey announced that he was resigning because, he said, he had had an extramarital affair with a man.
Despite the circumstances surrounding his departure and his uneven legacy as the state's chief executive, Mr. McGreevey refused to view his return to the office he once held as bittersweet.
''It was pleasant,'' Mr. McGreevey said in a telephone interview hours after his visit. ''It was just nice to see all of the good people who continue to work in government even though I've moved to another chapter.''
During the brief appearance, Governor Corzine spoke briefly with Mr. McGreevey and his father, Jack, a former Marine drill sergeant; Mr. Corzine is a veteran of the Marine Reserves.
''Governor Corzine was extremely gracious to my parents, which meant a great deal to me,'' Mr. McGreevey said. ''Jon is always kind. He and my dad discussed the Marine Corps.''
The portrait depicts Mr. McGreevey seated on the edge of a desk, wearing a dark suit and a red tie. His right hand rests on a book of New Jersey laws; he is framed by a window that opens onto a green lawn and flanked by the New Jersey and United States flags.
''The artist was very kind,'' Mr. McGreevey said jokingly. ''Most importantly, my mother liked it.''
The hanging of the portrait, which was completed in August 2005, had been expected as long ago as December 2005. But an agreement over how to handle the unveiling was elusive.
Some in the State House questioned whether the timing of the unveiling -- a private ceremony after a long holiday weekend -- was meant to circumvent awkward questions about Mr. McGreevey's tenure.
Through a spokesman, Mr. Corzine said that there was no subtext to the scheduling.
''We were looking for a mutually agreeable time,'' said the spokesman, Anthony Coley.
For his part, Mr. McGreevey said that there were more practical concerns.
''We did the morning so Mark could make the train for New York,'' he said.

The steeply rising cost of preventing and suppressing wildfires, which burned more of the American landscape in 2006 than in any other year since at least 1960, is creating a rift between Washington and state and local governments over how the burden ought to be shouldered.
A study issued in November by the inspector general's office of the United States Department of Agriculture, the parent agency of the Forest Service, said the nature of the wildfire threat was changing as private homes and communities pushed ever closer to the boundaries of once-remote public lands. Those communities and landowners, rather than federal taxpayers, should have to pay for more of their own fire protection, the report concluded.
A study issued by the parent agency of the Forest Service concluded that communities and landowners should pay for more of their own fire protection.
The steeply rising cost of preventing and suppressing wildfires, which burned more of the American landscape in 2006 than in any other year since at least 1960, is creating a rift between Washington and state and local governments over how the burden ought to be shouldered.
A study issued in November by the inspector general's office of the United States Department of Agriculture, the parent agency of the Forest Service, said the nature of the wildfire threat was changing as private homes and communities pushed ever closer to the boundaries of once-remote public lands. Those communities and landowners, rather than federal taxpayers, should have to pay for more of their own fire protection, the report concluded.
States and local governments are gearing up to fight back in Congress, arguing that decades of federal mismanagement of national forests and open spaces, not development, created the threat and that little communities with few resources are neither responsible for it nor equipped to make a difference.
The pattern of wildfire distribution during the recently ended fire season, which charred more than 9.8 million acres, supports either side. According to federal statistics, more state, county and private lands burned than in any other year since 1997 -- about half the total 2006 losses -- primarily because of monstrous blazes in Oklahoma, in Texas and across the Upper Plains, regions where most property is privately owned.
That finding, though also driven by broader factors like drought and heat that have little to do with residential development in fire-prone areas, supports the federal contention that the government has had to shift an increasingly large share of its resources from the task of protecting its own forests to firefighting elsewhere.
In some places, though, the issue is more complex. In Stillwater County, Mont., north of Yellowstone National Park, for example, the small, long-established towns of Nye and Fishtail are bordered on two sides by national forest. In early July, the first of two huge fires erupted in the forest and roared into those communities, where 100,000 acres of mostly private land and 32 homes were burned. The blaze was the worst in the county's history, local officials say.
''The forest is very dry and primed for fires started by lightning, and when that occurs in a forest not managed as well as it could have been, it soon gets out of control and meets the community,'' said Ken Mesch, the Stillwater County disaster and emergency services coordinator. ''If the federal government started pulling back money for fire suppression, they would be hanging us out to dry.''
Federal land managers say protection of private land at the boundaries of public space -- called the wildland-urban interface -- is the fastest-growing component of the nation's firefighting budget. In 2003 and 2004, the inspector general's report estimated, the Forest Service spent at least half a billion dollars, and perhaps as much as a billion, protecting private property in such areas.
The trend is similar at the Interior Department, which oversees hundreds of millions of acres of public lands in the West through the Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Park Service. Fire prevention activities -- controlled fires or thinning of burnable vegetation -- have shifted there toward the interface lands, said Lynn Scarlett, deputy interior secretary.
Ms. Scarlett said that almost half the 1.1 million acres treated by the Interior Department for fire-risk reduction in 2006 were in interface zones, about double the proportion as recently as 2002. She said her department, too, was considering that it demand increased cost-sharing by state and local governments, though she emphasized that any outcome would have to be collaborative.
''One of the last things you want in an emergency is people squabbling over who's going to pay,'' she said.
The report from the Agriculture Department's inspector general said a major problem was simply the weight of accumulated assumptions: fire response in the West has long meant federal authorities' riding to the rescue, with no questions asked and no cost too great to bear.
''Public expectations and uncertainties about protection responsibilities,'' the report said, ''compel the Forest Service to suppress fires aggressively and at great expense when private property is at risk, even when fires pose little threat to National Forest system land.''
About 8.5 million homes were built at the wildland-urban interface within the interior West in the 1990s alone, according to the Forest Service. But state and local officials say they already pay their share to protect those communities and homeowners, partly because the residential growth has coincided with years of federal budget cuts. Arizona, for instance, now has 12 to 14 air tanker firefighting aircraft under contract, up from 2 to 4 in 2005, as a result of reduced federal spending on tankers, said Lori Faeth, a policy adviser to Gov. Janet Napolitano.
''Our forests are in the condition they are because of poor federal management,'' Ms. Faeth said. ''They've put us in this position, and they have the responsibility to pay for it.''
The Forest Service's director of fire and aviation management, Tom Harbour, said the agency would follow up on the inspector general's recommendations. ''We're not going to walk away,'' Mr. Harbour said, ''but we will engage in a vigorous debate with our partners about the right way to split the pie.''
Still, money is only part of the issue, he said. Communities and developers in the West should be thinking in new ways as well, he said, including the use of fire-wise construction techniques and preparedness plans that involve residents in their own defense even before fires start.
Many land experts say hardly anyone is addressing the most tangled and emotional question raised by the debate: how much or how little voice federal land managers should have in land-use decisions.
''Thinking through in advance the fire implications of a new subdivision next to a national forest boundary -- that doesn't happen,'' said James L. Caswell, administrator of the Idaho Office of Species Conservation.
Given the property rights issue and the tension between local governments and Washington that has shaped the West's culture for the last century, a system of planning that allows federal officials veto power would seem unlikely.
Mr. Caswell said better planning must be part of the solution. ''A thousand houses next to a boundary could overwhelm all the other cost-control issues,'' he said.
''But,'' he added, ''that's a very emotional topic, so it's really hard to deal with.''

Massachusetts, the only state where same-sex marriage is legal, took a first step toward possibly banning it Tuesday when legislators voted to advance a constitutional amendment defining marriage as the union between a man and a woman.
The amendment now requires the approval of at least 50 legislators in another vote in the 2007-8 session. Then it would be placed on the November 2008 ballot as a referendum question.
Legislators voted to advance an amendment defining marriage as the union between a man and a woman.
Massachusetts, the only state where same-sex marriage is legal, took a first step toward possibly banning it Tuesday when legislators voted to advance a constitutional amendment defining marriage as the union between a man and a woman.
The amendment now requires the approval of at least 50 legislators in another vote in the 2007-8 session. Then it would be placed on the November 2008 ballot as a referendum question.
If it passed, the amendment would not invalidate the more than 8,000 same-sex marriages that have taken place since they became legal in May 2004. But it would prevent future marriages of gay men and lesbians.
''This is democracy in action,'' said Kris Mineau, president of the Massachusetts Family Institute, which sponsored the amendment. ''It's giving people the opportunity to vote on the most essential institution in human existence -- marriage.''
Arline Isaacson, co-chairwoman of the Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus, choked back tears.
''The price that our children and families will pay is so severe that we simply have to recommit ourselves to fight this some more,'' she said.
The swiftness of the vote on Tuesday surprised people on both sides of the issue, taking place without any debate, just minutes after the constitutional convention had been gaveled into session. Proponents of the amendment needed just 50 of the legislature's 200 lawmakers to support it; the final vote was 61 in favor of the amendment and 132 opposed.
Later in the day, supporters of same-sex marriage persuaded lawmakers to reconsider the amendment, but the second vote, 62 to 134, only affirmed the results of the first.
National groups on both sides of the issue said they would commit resources to help advocates wage battle here. This past Election Day, the tide had seemed to be turning slightly in favor of supporters of same-sex marriage, with the defeat of an opposition amendment in Arizona and passage of seven others by slimmer margins than similar amendments in 2004.
Just two months ago, at an earlier constitutional convention, the legislature appeared to have essentially killed the proposal to allow a vote. During that session, legislators recessed without voting on the amendment, tabling it until Jan. 2, the last day of the legislative session. Both sides said they expected that lawmakers would then vote to end the session without taking up the measure.
But last week, the state's Supreme Judicial Court, which three years ago ruled that same-sex marriage should be legal, threw a wrench into things.
The court chided lawmakers for their maneuvers to avoid a vote on the amendment, saying the legislature had demonstrated ''indifference to, or defiance of, its constitutional duties.''
The court said it was not empowered to order the legislature to vote on the amendment, which petitioners, including Gov. Mitt Romney, had asked it to do. But the court's criticism appeared to be enough to make some lawmakers, including some supporters of same-sex marriage, decide to allow a vote.
''Certainly, the court ruling changed the atmosphere this week,'' said Mr. Mineau, whose organization had gathered a record 170,000 petition signatures to get the amendment before the legislature.
Ms. Isaacson said, ''The S.J.C. decision really tipped the scales against us.''
Tuesday's vote was considered a victory for Governor Romney, a Republican who has used his opposition to same-sex marriage as a conservative rallying point as he has laid the groundwork for an expected run for the presidency in 2008.
In a statement Tuesday, Mr. Romney called the marriage vote ''a huge victory for the people of Massachusetts.''
By contrast, the vote was something of a rebuke to the incoming governor, Deval L. Patrick, a supporter of same-sex marriage who on Thursday will be sworn in as the first Democrat to occupy the governor's office in 16 years. On Tuesday, before the constitutional convention, Mr. Patrick met with the House speaker and the Senate president, both Democrats, to urge them to find a way to defeat the amendment, even if it meant adjourning without voting on it.
''I believe that adults should be free to choose whom they wish to love and to marry,'' Mr. Patrick said, adding that he objected to using the constitutional amendment process ''to give a minority fewer freedoms than the majority.''
After the vote, Mr. Patrick said in a statement, ''We have work to do over the next year to turn this around.''
The new legislature taking office this month includes more supporters of same-sex marriage. But people on both sides of the issue said it was not clear if the balance had tipped enough to sideline the amendment.
Ms. Isaacson and other gay rights activists have said that, should the initiative get on the 2008 ballot, they fear losing to an expensive campaign that would draw opponents from around the country. Polls in Massachusetts have generally found that just over half of the citizens surveyed supported same-sex marriage, but about the same number wanted the constitutional amendment to come before voters.
On Tuesday, scores of demonstrators lined the street outside the Statehouse and spilled into the building.
''I think it is going to get defeated next time around,'' said Lea Roy, 38, a supporter of same-sex marriage from Fitchburg who hopes to marry her girlfriend. ''It's something you always dream about growing up -- getting married. Then it's like, I'm gay and we're not allowed to get married.''
But David Wilson, who, along with his partner, Rob Compton, was a plaintiff in the original lawsuit that legalized same-sex marriage, was less optimistic.
''It feels like the rug has been pulled out from under us,'' said Mr. Wilson, who has married Mr. Compton. ''Maybe I'll feel better tomorrow, but today I feel like I've been shot.''
Bea Martins, 63, an opponent of same-sex marriage from Fall River, said she was ''very pleased'' by the vote. As the initiative winds its way through the rest of the process, Ms. Martins said, ''my counsel is we continue praying to the dear Lord for justice to be done.''

The Delaware River, which separates New Jersey and Pennsylvania, is putting distance between the Democratic governors of the two states, who are at a standoff over the financing and environmental implications of a plan to deepen the river for larger cargo ships and oil tankers.
After a yearlong impasse over the $300 million project, which requires approval and money from both states, Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania has halted the work of the Delaware River Port Authority, a bistate agency he heads that regulates activity along the river, blocking construction projects and increasing debt. He warned at a recent news conference that ''our patience is running out.''
The Democratic Governors of New Jersey and Pennsylvania are at a standoff over a plan to deepen the Delaware River for larger cargo ships and oil tankers.
The Delaware River, which separates New Jersey and Pennsylvania, is putting distance between the Democratic governors of the two states, who are at a standoff over the financing and environmental implications of a plan to deepen the river for larger cargo ships and oil tankers.
After a yearlong impasse over the $300 million project, which requires approval and money from both states, Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania has halted the work of the Delaware River Port Authority, a bistate agency he heads that regulates activity along the river, blocking construction projects and increasing debt. He warned at a recent news conference that ''our patience is running out.''
But Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey said that officials in his state are not yet convinced that Pennsylvania's recent promises to accept the bulk of the waste from the riverbed and cover any cost overruns would allay their concerns. Moreover, Mr. Corzine, who has yet to offer a definitive position on the project, has expressed doubts about it from an environmental standpoint.
''I understand his frustration,'' Mr. Corzine said in an interview. ''We have people who are frustrated also about the environment, and I'm certain with all the details, some of the conceptual ideas that have been framed, we'll work through it.''
The debate over the Delaware predates both governors, and for many of those who have followed it -- environmentalists and developers alike -- the stakes are high.
Backers say the proposal to deepen more than 100 miles of the river, from the mouth of Delaware Bay north to Philadelphia, to 45 feet from 40 feet, is critical to the revitalization of the Port of Philadelphia. Critics contend the dredging could shake free contaminated sediments that could be absorbed by fish or make their way into the water supply.
''It's a giant waste of money that's going to hurt the environment and waste taxpayers' resources,'' said Jeff Tittel, executive director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club.
Mr. Tittel challenged Mr. Rendell's contention that the dredging would make the Philadelphia port more competitive with other major East Coast ports. ''The port will still be 100 miles from the ocean,'' Mr. Tittel pointed out, ''and will still not be competitive with Port of Newark, Norfolk, or even Halifax.''
Governor Rendell continues to push for the project as a potential economic development engine. He pointed to a similar, if more costly, dredging project effectively undertaken at the Port of New York in the last six years, asking in a recent interview, ''Why is it good enough in the north and not good enough in the south?''
Meanwhile, his refusal to take action to reduce the interest rates on bonds issued by the Delaware River Port Authority has increased the agency's debt by $7 million.
In addition to agreeing to handle waste and extra costs, Governor Rendell has also promised to appoint a committee to examine the environmental impact of the 10-year project. But Governor Corzine dismissed these concessions, saying, ''It would be an overreading of that to say we've come to an agreement.''
Those who know both men and understand the dispute said that they are dismayed that the governors of neighboring states, both from the same political party, have been unable to have a meeting of the minds.
''Hopefully, the two governors will sit down and resolve this,'' said State Senator Stephen M. Sweeney, a Democrat from Gloucester County in southern New Jersey and an opponent of the plan. ''Honestly, I haven't heard anything about this in a year.''
Mr. Rendell and Mr. Corzine, who have both played roles in the national Democratic Party, have enjoyed a cordial if not particularly deep friendship. But their styles are as different as the environs of the well-heeled New Jersey suburb of Summit, where Mr. Corzine lived while he was chief executive at Goldman Sachs, and the rough-and-tumble, in-your-face attitude of South Philadelphia, in Mr. Rendell's adopted hometown.
The garrulous Mr. Rendell, who will be 63 this week, is a former prosecutor and Philadelphia mayor who once instigated spectators to throw snowballs on the field at a pro football game. The earnest Mr. Corzine, who just turned 60, is a multimillionaire and former Wall Street trader who successfully tackled fiscal problems in his first year but sometimes struggled to get along with state legislative leaders from his own party.
Despite his frustration, Governor Rendell said the issue has not affected his friendship with Mr. Corzine, a relationship that he said dates to his successful 1991 campaign for mayor of Philadelphia, when Mr. Corzine, then a trader at Goldman Sachs, was a significant campaign contributor.
''I think he's a great, great, great public servant,'' said Mr. Rendell, a native New Yorker, who before becoming governor in 2003 served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee. ''I believe that Governor Corzine has acted in good faith and does intend to resolve this.''
Mr. Corzine, the former head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, declined to discuss how the dispute had affected his rapport with Mr. Rendell. Indeed, he was reluctant to talk about the matter.
Days after Mr. Rendell's acerbic comment that New Jersey officials are ''running out of excuses,'' Mr. Corzine would say only, ''I actually think it's better for us to have private conversations about it.''
Mr. Rendell said that he has tried to be accommodating with New Jersey officials, who over the past 14 months had asked to delay talks on the dredging project while political campaigns were going on in both states. Also, Mr. Corzine was trying to work out the details of his first budget, which led to a seven-day shutdown in July of the state government. He said that he and Mr. Corzine were scheduled to meet this month on the issue.
''I don't know what reason they'll find now,'' Mr. Rendell said of the prospect of any future delays.
David P. Rebovich, director of the Institute of New Jersey Politics at Rider University, said the showdown has highlighted Mr. Rendell's ''feisty, quick-witted, can-do style'' and the fact that Mr. Corzine is ''much more thoughtful and deliberative.''
''The impasse isn't doing either state much good,'' Professor Rebovich added.

Swollen ticket lines, shouting children, tempers rising as the movies sold out: This was any suburban multiplex during the holidays.
But different.
Half the screens at the Columbia Park Cinema 12 in North Bergen, N.J., are permanently reserved for Indian films.
Swollen ticket lines, shouting children, tempers rising as the movies sold out: This was any suburban multiplex during the holidays.
But different.
Vada pav sandwiches and mango kulfi were sold at the concession stand. Conversations were in Gujarati or Hindi. A poster in the lobby advertised an action film starring Aishwarya Rai on one of six screens showing Indian cinema.
''It reminds me of home,'' said Ambika Sikka, 26, who had come with her husband to see ''Bhagam Bhag,'' a movie about a theater troupe that travels from India to London. (Plot: Harassed actress quits troupe. Actors search for new heroine in London. Accidentally steal heroin from gangsters. Mystery and hilarity follow.)
The Columbia Park Cinema 12 sits at one end of a gloomy underground parking lot at a shopping mall just off the approach to the Lincoln Tunnel. Half of its 12 screens, called CinePlaza, are permanently reserved for Indian films, making it the largest such complex on the East Coast, according to its operator, Vijay Shah.
On Wednesday nights, when the tickets are half price, the 12-plex is crammed with customers eager to see the latest hits from Bollywood, India's Bombay-based, Hindi-language movie industry, or other regional Indian cinema.
For the mostly Indian audience that comes to this transformed suburban theater, a trip to the movies is still an outing, at once a family affair, a reminder of home and a chance to experience a beloved cinematic tradition.
''The Indian movie theaters are like community centers,'' said Suketu Mehta of Brooklyn, who wrote ''Maximum City: Bombay Lost and Found,'' and has attended the CinePlaza with his parents. ''It's a very cheap round trip home.''
But these days Mr. Shah's business, one of the most successful Bollywood movie houses in the country, is being threatened.
Two weeks ago, the owner of the mall, Forest City Ratner Companies, won approval to redevelop the section where the CinePlaza is situated, perhaps into a residential tower, according to township officials.
''I'm not sure what I'm going to do,'' said Mr. Shah, an engineer who entered the cinema business several years ago, and has already changed location once.
He said he had already started looking for another space to rent. ''I knew that sooner or later this was going to happen,'' he said.
Indian cinemas have sprung up across the country, signaling both the growth of the South Asian population and the increasing popularity of films from the subcontinent. Last year, Hindi-language films, many of them made in what is now called Mumbai, had by far their most successful year in the United States, with, among others, 8 of the 15 highest-grossing foreign-language films, said Gitesh Pandya, the editor of the Web site boxofficeguru.com.
There were 228,000 Asian Indians living in New Jersey in 2005, according to the Census Bureau, and the number living in New York City is about the same.
''For South Asians afflicted by homesickness like I was, it was a wonderful place where other people were in love with these crazy movies like you were,'' said Mr. Mehta, who as a teenager watched Indian movies on Queens Boulevard after his family moved to Jackson Heights from India.
When videotapes of the movies became easier to find, some theaters closed down. But in the mid-1990s, as South Asians grew tired of the poor quality of the videotapes -- or perhaps just craved an evening out -- cinemas regained their popularity.
Today, Indian films can be found playing all over the country, with one Web site listing almost 100 cinemas in 20 states. In California, for example, the Naz8 cinemas feature eight-screen multiplexes, many showing the same films as Mr. Shah's theater.
Mr. Shah and Naz8 share a large part of the American market, although they face competition from distributors of Indian films who make deals with American theater owners on their own, Mr. Pandya said.
About 6:30 on Wednesday night, Mr. Shah buzzed around the lobby of the cinema with a walkie-talkie as the crowds poured in.
Tushar Gupta and his friends, all college students, took a bus here, trusting that Govinda, a star of ''Bhagam Bhag,'' would make them laugh.
''Let's hope he lives up to expectations,'' Mr. Gupta said. Govinda's return to the screen after a hiatus in politics was one of many entertainment subplots here, a comeback almost everyone seemed to comment on.
Birender Anand, 20, waited for his cousin in front of a large, cardboard diorama for ''Dhoom 2,'' a popular action movie featuring brooding, gorgeous Bollywood stars. He was home from college in Ohio, and happy to be among so many Indians. Mr. Anand said his turban drew a lot of attention in Ohio -- ''I get stuff all the time.''
Lines formed, showtimes passed, the cinema became busier and Mr. Shah became irritable, at one point threatening to cancel a screening if order was not restored in a line. Afterward, he would not say how many tickets had been sold, and was generally secretive when it came to business affairs, citing worries about competitors. But that night, several hundred people watched films at his six cinemas, which seat approximately 1,300 people.
Mr. Shah said he had plans to expand his audience, perhaps by showing films in Spanish, Korean and Japanese. ''I can do this with passion,'' he said. ''I do my homework. I am the janitor and the owner.''
Asked if he was ready to open an all-Indian movie theater, maybe with the help of an outside investor, Mr. Shah said there was not enough business to make such a project sustainable.
But Mr. Mehta said it was only a matter of time before a multiscreen theater showing only Indian films opened in the area.
''I think there should be some kind of landmark status, some kind of protection for places like this,'' he said.
He explained that unlike those in the United States, many cinemas in India were divided by class, ranging from multiplexes with waiters to traveling tents.
''What unites the people in the audience here is love of Bollywood films, and homesickness,'' he said. ''For three hours, they are momentarily sated by watching these creatures of light.''

Sale prices for Manhattan apartments fell in the last quarter of 2006, while the pace of sales was reported to be strong and the backlog of unsold apartments fell, according to several market studies released yesterday by large real estate brokerage firms.
The new quarterly numbers led brokers and market analysts to conclude that the Manhattan real estate market -- with its legendary high prices -- appeared to have so far escaped the worst of the real estate market excesses, like large price cuts by developers, reported across the country.
Sale prices for Manhattan apartments fell in the last quarter of 2006, while the pace of sales was reported to be strong, according to market studies.
Sale prices for Manhattan apartments fell in the last quarter of 2006, while the pace of sales was reported to be strong and the backlog of unsold apartments fell, according to several market studies released yesterday by large real estate brokerage firms.
The new quarterly numbers led brokers and market analysts to conclude that the Manhattan real estate market -- with its legendary high prices -- appeared to have so far escaped the worst of the real estate market excesses, like large price cuts by developers, reported across the country.
''It shows us that we hit the soft landing that a lot of people were hoping for,'' said Gregory J. Heym, an economist who prepared market studies for two brokerage firms, Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property.
The new figures were also reported in a series of competitive and sometimes contradictory studies. One report, released by Prudential Douglas Elliman, reported a 5 percent decline in the average apartment sale price, compared with the previous quarter, while one by the Corcoran Group put the decline at 1.5 percent. Both put the average sale price for all apartments at more than $1.2 million.
A third study by Mr. Heym showed that average apartment prices actually increased by 5 percent from the prior quarter. But even this study showed weakness in the market. It found that prices for co-ops, the older apartments that make up most of Manhattan's residential real estate, declined by 5 percent, with these declines offset by increased sale prices for condominiums. He said more than half the sales were in new luxury buildings that command premium prices.
Yet what heartened many market watchers was the market's overall stability, and the rising sales, according to the Prudential report, in what is traditionally a weak quarter. Average prices were higher last quarter than they were in the same quarter a year ago. For all of 2006, average prices were also higher than the previous year, which included the peak quarters of the recent real estate boom.
At the end of December, the Prudential report found that the backlog of unsold apartments had dropped to 5,934 from 7,623, a decline of 22 percent and slightly below the inventory reported a year before, as apartments were sold and overpriced apartments were taken off the market.
At the same time, the Prudential report tracked 2,441 sales in the last quarter of 2006, an increase of 15.5 percent from the prior quarter and a 55 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2005.
Jonathan J. Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc., prepared the Prudential report. He said some of the increase in sales might be exaggerated because of improved reporting by New York City, which last summer began providing sales information for previously undisclosed co-op sales. But he said that the increase in reported sales was the largest he had seen in several years, especially in the fourth quarter when sales typically decline an average of 8 percent.
But he said that he believed the market was strengthening and that it was now ''just barely'' a buyer's market, but one in which buyers were frustrated because sellers were not making significant concessions. He found that the average discount from the final asking price for an apartment fell to 2.8 percent from 4 percent in the previous quarter.
Pamela Liebman, president of the Corcoran Group, said that sellers are now generally pricing their apartments realistically, and that with the economy strong and Wall Street bonuses high, ''the psychology of the market is very positive.''
''The big story here is the story that never happened,'' she said. ''The story was supposed to be that prices would crash in 2006, and a strong buyer's market will emerge. Buyers can certainly pick and choose, but those who think they are going to have a field day out there right now are mistaken.''
Ms. Liebman said the fear of a price collapse caused by a construction boom has not been borne out so far, and the outlook remained good for this year. She said several thousand planned condominiums have instead been turned into hotels and office buildings, as hotel profits and office rentals have risen.
The trends in the Manhattan real estate market have always been something of a puzzle, since the average and median prices tend to move up and down with the changing mix of large and small apartments and of apartments in old and new buildings.
In addition, the various market studies augment public records of sales with private databases compiled by brokers and appraisers of recent closings that have not yet been reported by the city.
New building sales also distort the data, since sales often close up to a year or more after they go to contract. Ms. Liebman predicted that average sale prices would rise next year as contracts already signed at new expensive luxury buildings with multiple sales of more than $10 million, like 15 Central Park West and the Plaza on Fifth Avenue, are completed.
Several reports showed significant price increases in very large apartments with four or more bedrooms and in studios. The reports generally showed the largest increases in very large apartments with four or more bedrooms, with declines in average prices for two-bedroom apartments, which still averaged above $1.5 million per apartment.
Overall, 2006 ended with an average price increase of 6 percent over the previous year's sales, Mr. Miller said, while the median went up by 11 percent.
Mr. Heym, the economist at Halstead and Brown Harris Stevens, attributed the continued strength of the market to the local economy, which he said has produced more jobs last year than in any year since the 2000 boom, and that interest rates that have remained low. Mr. Heym said, ''2006 turned out to be a really good year, much better than people thought.''

The dollar slumped yesterday and the euro climbed to a three-week high against the currency.
A steady slide in the value of the dollar since late 2005, primarily against the euro and the British pound, has steepened over the last month amid indications that interest rates will rise in Europe, while the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates this year.
Countries with large dollar holdings are showing a new willingness to dump the dollar in favor of the rising euro.
The dollar slumped yesterday and the euro climbed to a three-week high against the currency.
A steady slide in the value of the dollar since late 2005, primarily against the euro and the British pound, has steepened over the last month amid indications that interest rates will rise in Europe, while the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates this year.
At the same time, countries with large dollar holdings are showing a new willingness to dump the dollar in favor of the rising euro, though the current activity is seen as posing little long-term risk to the dollar.
Late last month, the United Arab Emirates became the latest country to shift more of its currency reserves away from the dollar, joining Russia, Switzerland, Venezuela and others.
Those moves coincide with ambiguous signals from China about possibly pulling back from the dollar, and recent word from Iran, the world's fourth-largest oil producer, that it would prefer euros as payment for oil, which is typically priced in dollars.
But currency experts say that this turn away from the dollar is not likely to do any long-term damage to the currency's value for a number of reasons. First, the motives of central banks that are adding other currencies to their reserves do not appear to be driven by the belief that the euro will eventually supplant the dollar as the world's key currency. Rather, these central banks are doing what investors do to cut risk: diversifying their portfolios.
Moreover, the amount of currency moved so far has been relatively small in a global market that trades trillions of dollars a day -- only about $2 billion in the case of the United Arab Emirates, for example.
''There is some indication that central banks are moving to diversify reserves, but it's at a very slow pace,'' said David Powell, a currency analyst with IDEAglobal. ''Is it the start of a massive shift out of the dollar? I would say no.''
Yesterday, the euro traded at $1.3272, up from $1.3198 late Friday in New York. The British pound was at $1.9721, up from $1.9586. The United States dollar index, a measure of the dollar's strength against a basket of currencies, fell to 83.23 from 83.65 on Friday. In February 2002, the index was at 120.
But trading was thinner than usual yesterday as financial markets were closed in the United States, as were markets in Tokyo and Singapore.
In 2006, the euro appreciated more than 11 percent against the dollar, while the British pound rose nearly 14 percent against the dollar.
But the dollar is not likely to start flowing with great speed out of central banks because foreign countries risk devaluing their investments if they do so. Even the slightest suggestion that a country is thinking about swapping dollars for euros risks sending the value of the dollar falling, and in turn hurts all foreign investors in American securities.
The case of China, which holds more Treasury securities than any other foreign nation except Japan, offers an example of why countries would be reluctant to dump their dollar reserves. In October, the most recent month for which figures are available from the Treasury Department, China held $345 billion in Treasury securities. That was up from $301 billion a year earlier. Its currency holdings total $1 trillion. About $700 billion of that, economists estimate, is in dollars.
So in many ways, it is in China's best interest not to let the dollar's value slip. Heavy sales of the dollar could make it harder for the People's Bank of China to manage its gradual appreciation of the yuan against the dollar. Anything more abrupt, Beijing fears, would make Chinese goods less competitive in the United States and pose problems domestically for some of the loans from its state banks. And if the dollar drops too much, the value of China's holdings would decrease, limiting the lending ability of its banks.
Nonetheless, the rising euro is not something the United States or foreign investors can afford to ignore.
''You have to start to thinking that the euro can be of some risk to the dollar,'' said Shaun Osbourne, chief currency strategist at TD Securities in Toronto. ''Over the course of the next 5 or 10 years, I don't think there's any danger that the dollar's pre-eminence is threatened. But in the long run, there is certainly the risk that does happen.''
One issue driving investors from the dollar is the possibility that interest rates in the United States and Europe may move farther apart.
Financial markets are currently expecting at least one interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve sometime next year. That contrasts with predictions of further rate increases by the European Central Bank.
''A lot of foreign investors think the Fed is going to cut rates in 2007, and that's a rather dollar-bearish thing,'' said Julia Coronado, senior economist with Barclays Capital.
Some economists predict the dollar will fall further in 2007. The euro finished 2006 at $1.31, and some economists see it climbing near $1.40 -- a high in its seven-year history.
''We believe that the dollar's decline versus the euro has further to run, with $1.38 a possible destination for the pair over the next six months,'' said Tom Levinson, a foreign exchange strategist with ING Wholesale Banking in London.
Still, many economists are unwilling to predict that the dollar faces an inevitable demise. ''The dollar is still the world's No. 1 currency, and it's going to stay that way,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist for Global Insight. ''The euro is gradually going to become more important, but I don't see it becoming more important than the dollar.''

Eugen David, a small-time farmer with a chipped tooth and muddy boots in this obscure wrinkle of Transylvania, is an unlikely man to attract the attention of movie stars and moguls. But he counts Vanessa Redgrave, George Soros and Teddy Goldsmith among his backers in a land battle with a Canadian gold mining company.
The company, Gabriel Resources, owns the rights to mine the hills here and wants Mr. David, 41, to leave his 50 acres of land so that the company can carve out what would be Europe's largest open-pit gold mine. Mr. David says he isn't budging.
''We don't want to move,'' he says, staring across at the brown-gray stain of Rosia Montana's defunct gold mine, which would be swallowed by Gabriel Resource's huge project.
In the old days, a pipsqueak like Mr. David wouldn't stand a chance fighting powerful and sophisticated adversaries like Gabriel Resources and its minority partner, the Romanian government.
But this is the Internet age, when local activists like Mr. David can tap into an increasingly well-oiled global network of non-governmental organizations for financial and political support on a long list of causes and emerge with almost as much clout as any corporation.
Mr. David's stubbornness has struck a chord with the anti-globalization movement. Gabriel Resources' proposed open-pit, cyanide-leaching mining process has also drawn the ire of international environmentalists who are now trying to stop it.
They just might win.
Mining is one of the world's most unpopular pursuits these days, particularly the gigantic gouging that leaves the earth pocked with moonscape-like craters a mile or more wide. Gold mining is disdained even more because of the perceived frivolity of its end: to provide lucre for the rich, status for the everyman and hidden stores of wealth for nations.
But it also has a strong allure, particularly for resource-rich countries like Romania that are struggling to develop impoverished communities that need jobs.
The $3.7 billion project would plow more than $2 billion into the Romanian economy and could earn Gabriel Resources and its shareholders profits of $1 billion or more. And the company involved here, a Toronto-based corporation with market capitalization of $1 billion, is run by savvy mining executives, many of them highly experienced from cutting their teeth building the Barrick Gold Corporation, the largest gold mining company in the world.
The allure is perhaps stronger in Romania because the country was created, in a way, by gold mining.
Early in the second century A.D., Emperor Trajan extended Roman territory to include what is now Transylvania, in the western half of Romania, to mine Europe's most important gold deposits. The mines helped finance the expansion of the empire to its peak. When the Romans abandoned the territory almost 200 years later, they left behind colonists who are the ancestors of Romanians today.
When the Romans left, the mining did not stop. The eventual ruling dynasty, the Hapsburgs, and the Communists, who turned to open-pit mining, continued the process, though with dwindling efficiency. The mine was finally shut in early 2006.
Gabriel Resources was born in the breakup of the state-owned economy after Communism's collapse when Romanian businessmen with little mining experience and suspected ties to the former secret police won a vast concession to exploit mineral deposits.
Mr. David and his neighbors realized six years ago that the company planned to expand the old mine and formed an association called Alburnus Maior -- Rosia Montana's Roman name -- to try to stop the project. They were engaged in an ineffective letter-writing campaign when the founders of Gabriel Resources moved the company's listing from Vancouver, British Columbia, to the more respectable Toronto Stock Exchange.
Mr. David's opposition might have withered had it not been for an ill-advised plan to build a Dracula theme park near the picturesque Romanian town of Sighisoara, once home to Vlad Dracula, the notorious Romanian ruler and inspiration for ''Dracula,'' the Bram Stoker novel.
Prince Charles of Britain, fond of Romania's old Saxon villages, was outraged. So was Teddy Goldsmith, the aging anti-globalist environmentalist and scion of a wealthy business family.
A Swiss-born environmental journalist named Stephanie Roth, who wrote for Mr. Goldsmith's magazine, The Ecologist, moved to Romania to help defeat the project. With such powerful forces aligned against it, the theme park for Sighisoara died. While in Romania, Ms. Roth heard about the Gabriel Resources' plan for Rosia Montana and went to meet Mr. David in April 2002. Within months, she had introduced him to some of the most powerful environmental organizations in the world.
''When I came there was no computer, no Web site,'' Ms. Roth said. ''I tried to empower the local organization.''
Ms. Roth started by helping Mr. David's group obtain a grant for a few hundred dollars from an American environmental organization, Global Greengrants Fund. They organized a public hearing in Rosia Montana that drew 40 non-governmental organizations with Romanian operations, including Greenpeace, and catapulted Mr. David's dispute onto the national stage.
Then Ms. Roth took to the road. By the time Gabriel Resources' founders turned the company over to more professional management in 2005, the company had an international coalition of nongovernmental organizations arrayed against it.
But the mining industry doesn't easily back down.
Hoping to extract an estimated 300 tons of gold and 1,200 tons of silver from the mine, Gabriel Resources introduced a public relations campaign with Madison Avenue-style television commercials and community sponsorships to win over 960 Rosia Montana families that it needed to relocate. It cast itself as an economic savior. It even countered a critical documentary with its own film, ''Mine Your Own Business.''
Some efforts backfired. Gabriel Resources helped sponsor the Transylvanian International Film Festival in nearby Cluj-Napoca. But when its organizers invited Ms. Redgrave to receive a lifetime achievement award, Ms. Roth quickly put the actress and Mr. David together.
Ms. Redgrave's acceptance speech became a rallying cry against Gabriel Resources' project. The anti-Gabriel Resources' movement had its mascot and the European press began covering the story.
Word of the movement had by then reached the Open Society Institute of George Soros, which has been working for years for more accountability from Romanian public officials.
''When guys in S.U.V.'s with bags full of cash show up in a poor locality in Romania, they can really make the law there,'' said Radu Motoc, project director of the Open Society Foundation-Romania.
Nearly all members of Rosia Montana's former and current council are either employed by Rosia Montana Gold, Gabriel's local subsidiary, or have family members who are, according to the foundation.
The foundation, which has already given $35,000 to the cause, says it plans to spend as much as $240,000 next year fighting the project and helping Mr. David. Because of the polarizing debate surrounding open-pit gold mining, it is hard to find an unbiased commentator to assess the risks and benefits of Gabriel Resources' proposed mine. A major focus of contention is the use of large quantities of highly toxic cyanide to separate gold and silver from the ore.
In 1999, Aurul, a joint venture of the Australian mining company, Esmeralda Exploration, and a Romanian national company, Remin, began a leaching operation to recover gold from old tailings in Baia Mare, or Great Mine, roughly 80 miles north of Rosia Montana. Like Gabriel Resources, the company promised a state-of-the-art, self-contained project that would not pose risks to the environment. But less than a year later, the dam holding back a lake of cyanide-laced water burst, sending 100,000 cubic meters of contaminated water downstream to the Danube, killing more than 1,200 tons of fish in Hungary.
Gabriel Resources says it would build in safeguards that were missing at Baia Mare. It has promised to convert most of the cyanide into a nontoxic compound before discharging it into the mine's tailing pond. It also promises to clean up pollution left by past mining operations and spend $70 million to do as much as possible to repair the altered landscape after its project is done.
''Arsenic, cadmium, nickel, lead,'' said Catalin Hosu, a public relations official for Gabriel Resources, ticking off just a few of the heavy metals that leach from ancient mines to give this valley its name; Rosia Montana means red mountain.
''We help the biodiversity; we help the environment,'' said Yani Roditis, Gabriel Resources' chief operating officer.
That's difficult for many people here to believe. The new project will grind down several hills, leaving four deep pits in their place, and slowly fill an entire valley with wastewater and tailings that will take years to solidify.
Robert E. Moran, a mining expert hired by the opposition to evaluate the impact of Gabriel Resources' plans, said that the mine, despite detoxification, would inevitably produce other toxic byproducts damaging to the environment, including heavy metals.
The controversy, meanwhile, has splintered the town, its buildings divided between those with signs that read, ''Property of Rosia Montana Gold Corp.'' and others that say, ''This Property Is Not For Sale.''
''I was born here, so why should I leave?'' said Gabriela Jorka, 38, who runs a small general store in Rosia Montana. ''I'd rather kill myself.''
Eugen Bobar, 60, the school principal, says that the dispute is pitting parents against children, husbands against wives. But only about 40 percent of the families to be relocated remain, and Mr. Bobar predicts that most of them will leave. ''Most of the people who talk about the environment are just making an excuse,'' Mr. Bobar said, sitting in the school's office late one night. ''They will leave for a good price.''
Mr. David, however, insists there is a committed core of opponents who will not sell, whatever the offer. In that case, Gabriel Resources warns, it may ask the state to step in and move people out by force. But that could lead to years of legal wrangling.
The company has told its shareholders that it expects to receive final approval for the project from the Romanian government this year and will start producing gold by mid-2009.
Gabriel Resources, which is based in Toronto, is, meanwhile, trying to win over the remaining holdouts. It is sponsoring education for underprivileged children in Rosia Montana through a nongovernmental organization run by Leslie Hawke, the mother of the actor Ethan Hawke and a celebrity herself in Romania. She supports the project.
''It's probably better that nothing happened, but the gold is there and if they don't do it, somebody else will,'' Ms. Hawke said. ''And I'd rather that they do it than somebody else.''

Iraq's Shiite-led government said Tuesday that it had ordered an investigation into the abusive behavior at the execution of Saddam Hussein, who was subjected to a battery of taunts by official Shiite witnesses and guards as he awaited his hanging.
Officials said a three-man Interior Ministry committee would look into the scenes that have caused outrage and public demonstrations among Mr. Hussein's Sunni Arab loyalists in Iraq, and widespread dismay elsewhere, especially in the Middle East. In an unofficial cellphone video recording that was broadcast around the world and posted on countless Web sites, Mr. Hussein is shown standing on the gallows platform with the noose around his neck at dawn on Saturday, facing a barrage of mockery and derision from unseen tormentors below the gallows.

Iraq's Shiite-led government said Tuesday that it had ordered an investigation into the abusive behavior at the execution of Saddam Hussein, who was subjected to a battery of taunts by official Shiite witnesses and guards as he awaited his hanging.
Officials said a three-man Interior Ministry committee would look into the scenes that have caused outrage and public demonstrations among Mr. Hussein's Sunni Arab loyalists in Iraq, and widespread dismay elsewhere, especially in the Middle East. In an unofficial cellphone video recording that was broadcast around the world and posted on countless Web sites, Mr. Hussein is shown standing on the gallows platform with the noose around his neck at dawn on Saturday, facing a barrage of mockery and derision from unseen tormentors below the gallows.
As the shock of those scenes reached a new crescendo in Iraq, American officials said that they had worked until the last hours of Mr. Hussein's life to persuade Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki to delay the execution. The officials, who spoke on condition that they not be identified, said they appealed to Mr. Maliki not to execute Mr. Hussein at dawn on Saturday because of the onset of a major Islamic festival, and because of constitutional and legal questions that the Americans believed threw the legitimacy of the execution into doubt.
But when Mr. Maliki decided to go ahead with the hanging, the Americans said they made no further attempts to stop it, having concluded that they could advise the Iraqis against the execution, but not prevent it if the Iraqis persisted, out of respect for Iraqi sovereignty.
When asked if that decision had been made in the White House, the Americans refused to say, noting only that it came some time before the final exchanges on Friday night. Mr. Hussein was hanged at 6:10 a.m. on Saturday, about seven hours after what the officials said was their final attempt to postpone the hanging.
''We told the prime minister that going forward on the first day of Id would have a negative reaction in the Islamic world, and among the Iraqi people,'' a senior American official said, recounting a telephone conversation with Mr. Maliki that began at 10:30 p.m. Baghdad time on Friday. The reference was to the Id al-Adha holiday, which began for Sunnis on Saturday, marking the end of the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. ''Therefore,'' the official said, ''we said we thought it would be better if they delayed until after Id, and use the delay to resolve the legal issues.''
The American official said that Mr. Maliki had never fully explained his urgency in carrying out the death sentence, which was upheld last Tuesday in an appeals court ruling that set off a 30-day countdown for executions to be carried out after a final appeal has been turned down. But the prime minister gave one explanation that appeared to weigh heavily on his mind, the American said, and that was his fear that Mr. Hussein might be the subject of an insurgent attempt to free him if the procedural wrangling over the execution were protracted.
''His concern was security, and that there was a danger that if it continued, maybe there would be a mass kidnapping to bargain for Saddam Hussein's release,'' the official said. ''He was concerned that he might somehow get free.''
The American decision to confirm that they had opposed the quick execution came after days of silence from the American Embassy and the United States military command in Baghdad, which appeared to have been shocked, like so many others, by the unofficial video recording that showed the bedlam at the gallows.
With some Iraqi politicians raising fresh demands for Mr. Maliki's dismissal, the Americans, in offering to have a senior official discuss the matter in a telephone interview with The New York Times, appeared eager to protect the Bush administration from a fresh surge of criticism for its handling of events in Iraq.
The official said that among American officials in Iraq who had tried to stop Mr. Maliki from rushing Mr. Hussein to the gallows, the reaction to the scenes of abuse had been one of dismay.
''Well, yes, when I think of the behavior of the people who were there, I'm disappointed and distressed, that's true,'' the official who spoke in the telephone interview said. He said he had been one of the Americans who intervened with Mr. Maliki on Friday night and earlier last week to try to delay the hanging.
Mr. Maliki seemed equally eager to ward off the opprobrium stirred by the execution. As his aides announced that the events at the hanging would be the subject of an inquiry, one of the officials who attended the hanging, a prosecutor at the trial that condemned Mr. Hussein to death, said that one of two men he had seen holding a cellphone camera aloft to make a video of Mr. Hussein's last moments -- up to and past the point where he fell through the trapdoor -- was Mowaffak al-Rubaie, Mr. Maliki's national security adviser. Attempts to reach Mr. Rubaie were unsuccessful. The prosecutor, Munkith al-Faroun, said the other man holding a cellphone above his head was also an official, but he could not recall his name.
The government inquiry was ordered as a groundswell of protest grew at Sunni population centers across Iraq. The protests, sporadic in the first 72 hours after the hanging, appeared to be building in intensity as Iraqi and American troops relaxed security cordons that had been thrown around centers of diehard support for Mr. Hussein, including his hometown, Tikrit, 100 miles north of Baghdad, and Awja, the village where he was born, a few miles away. The protesters carried portraits of Mr. Hussein, chanted his name, and fired weapons in the air.
Thousands of mourners flocked to Awja, where Mr. Hussein's body has lain in a reception hall. The body, in a plain wood coffin draped in an Iraqi flag, has become a point of pilgrimage for loyalists. Many of those reaching Awja have wept as they filed past the coffin, shouting slogans of fealty of the kind that were universal in Iraq when Mr. Hussein was the country's dictator.
''Maliki, you coward, you are an American agent,'' cried one demonstrator in Tikrit, referring to the prime minister. ''Iran, out, out!'' another man shouted, echoing anger among Sunnis at the rise to power in Baghdad of Shiite religious groups backed by Iran, including Mr. Maliki's Dawa Party.
After Mr. Maliki made it clear to the Americans in Baghdad that his decision was final, the official who discussed the events on Friday night said, American commanders were told to deliver Mr. Hussein to an execution bloc in the Kadhimiya district of northern Baghdad that Mr. Hussein's military intelligence agency used to execute countless opponents of his government. At 4 a.m., Mr. Hussein was flown by an American military helicopter from an American detention center and handed over to the Iraqis. He was hanged with only Iraqis present, in a group of about 25, including executioners and guards, according to accounts by American and Iraqi officials.
A postponement of the execution until after the holiday would have delayed it at least until Thursday of this week. But the American officials said they had made no stipulation as to how long the delay should be, since their concern, beyond respecting the sanctity of the Id al-Adha holiday, had been that Mr. Maliki should await a formal judicial ruling resolving the legal issues before going ahead with the hanging.
The Americans said Mr. Maliki had agreed, as the Americans had urged, to ask the chief judge of Iraq's Supreme Judicial Council, Midhat al-Mahmoud, to issue a formal written judgment saying that the uncompleted legal procedures that concerned the Americans were not necessary to the lawfulness of the hanging. But Judge Mahmoud refused, the Americans said, and around midnight on Friday the Iraqi leader decided to go ahead with the execution, signing a decree ordering that Mr. Hussein be ''hanged by the neck until dead.''
The legal issues the Americans said they urged Mr. Maliki to resolve before the hanging centered on a constitutional provision requiring Iraq's three-man presidency council to affirm all executions before they are carried out. That posed a potential obstacle to the hanging because Iraq's president, Jalal Talabani, is opposed to the death penalty. One of the other members of the council, Tariq al-Hashemi, is a Sunni from a moderate party that has disavowed Mr. Hussein, but has been careful not to endorse his trial and execution.
Mr. Maliki, in pushing ahead with the hanging, relied on a provision in the statute that established the Iraqi High Tribunal, which convicted Mr. Hussein, which said that the tribunal's verdicts, once upheld by its own appeal bench, were final and not subject to presidential review. It was that conflict the Americans said they wanted resolved by a written ruling from Judge Mahmoud. ''Mr. Maliki said that Judge Mahmoud had given that opinion orally, but we said it would be better for everybody if he said it in writing,'' the American official who discussed the standoff said.
Sami al-Askari, a political adviser to Mr. Maliki who attended the hanging, said in a telephone interview that the committee would question everyone present at the execution. He said those who used their cellphones to record the event would be one focus of the inquiry. He said his own observation was that the worst sectarian taunts had come from a guard he described as a poorly educated Shiite man with a thick Arabic accent. ''It was horrible, it was terrible, it was a mistake,'' he said. ''We were supposed to sit there quietly, just looking at what's going on.''
The first images of the execution that were released were in the form of an official video recording without sound. The unofficial cellphone images showed Mr. Hussein, with the noose around his neck, facing shouts of ''Go to hell!'' and taunts of ''Moktada! Moktada! Moktada!'' in reference to an unruly Shiite cleric, Moktada al-Sadr, who has become a populist hero among Shiites.
Speaking of those protesting the abuse of Mr. Hussein, Mr. Faroun, the prosecutor, asked, ''Where were these critics when Saddam's people were executing whole prisons full of innocent people?'' He said he had been deeply offended by the taunting of Mr. Hussein, and had tried to stop it. ''You heard my voice on the cellphone recording,'' he said. ''I was the one shouting, 'Please, no. The man is about to be executed.' ''
THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ
Correction:  January 4, 2007, Thursday  A front-page article yesterday about an Iraqi government investigation of the abusive behavior at the execution of Saddam Hussein, including the unauthorized cellphone camera recording of it, misstated the account of a witness who said he saw two others there holding cellphone cameras aloft to record Mr. Hussein's final moments. While the witness, Munkith al-Faroun, a prosecutor at Mr. Hussein's trial, said both of the others were officials, he did not identify one of them as Mowaffak al-Rubaie, the national security adviser. Mr. Rubaie, who could not be reached for comment in the article, said yesterday that he had handed his cellphone to security officials an hour before the hanging and had not recorded it.

It was every subway rider's nightmare, times two.
Who has ridden along New York's 656 miles of subway lines and not wondered: ''What if I fell to the tracks as a train came in? What would I do?''
A 50-year-old construction worker jumped on the subway tracks to save a man as a train approached.
It was every subway rider's nightmare, times two.
Who has ridden along New York's 656 miles of subway lines and not wondered: ''What if I fell to the tracks as a train came in? What would I do?''
And who has not thought: ''What if someone else fell? Would I jump to the rescue?''
Wesley Autrey, a 50-year-old construction worker and Navy veteran, faced both those questions in a flashing instant yesterday, and got his answers almost as quickly.
Mr. Autrey was waiting for the downtown local at 137th Street and Broadway in Manhattan around 12:45 p.m. He was taking his two daughters, Syshe, 4, and Shuqui, 6, home before work.
Nearby, a man collapsed, his body convulsing. Mr. Autrey and two women rushed to help, he said. The man, Cameron Hollopeter, 20, managed to get up, but then stumbled to the platform edge and fell to the tracks, between the two rails.
The headlights of the No. 1 train appeared. ''I had to make a split decision,'' Mr. Autrey said.
So he made one, and leapt.
Mr. Autrey lay on Mr. Hollopeter, his heart pounding, pressing him down in a space roughly a foot deep. The train's brakes screeched, but it could not stop in time.
Five cars rolled overhead before the train stopped, the cars passing inches from his head, smudging his blue knit cap with grease. Mr. Autrey heard onlookers' screams. ''We're O.K. down here,'' he yelled, ''but I've got two daughters up there. Let them know their father's O.K.'' He heard cries of wonder, and applause.
Power was cut, and workers got them out. Mr. Hollopeter, a student at the New York Film Academy, was taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. He had only bumps and bruises, said his grandfather, Jeff Friedman. The police said it appeared that Mr. Hollopeter had suffered a seizure.
Mr. Autrey refused medical help, because, he said, nothing was wrong. He did visit Mr. Hollopeter in the hospital before heading to his night shift. ''I don't feel like I did something spectacular; I just saw someone who needed help,'' Mr. Autrey said. ''I did what I felt was right.''

Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo began his first full day in office yesterday by meeting with officials who could play a pivotal role in investigating any state corruption cases in Albany. This opening step signals that he intends to join in Gov. Eliot Spitzer's calls for major reform of the capital's political culture.
Mr. Cuomo met first with P. David Soares, the Albany County district attorney, whose investigation last year of State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi's use of public employees as chauffeurs later prompted Mr. Hevesi to resign and plead guilty to a corruption charge. The two discussed collaborating on corruption cases, which could give muscle to Mr. Soares's efforts to pursue investigations despite his skeleton staff.

Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo began his first full day in office yesterday by meeting with officials who could play a pivotal role in investigating any state corruption cases in Albany. This opening step signals that he intends to join in Gov. Eliot Spitzer's calls for major reform of the capital's political culture.
Mr. Cuomo met first with P. David Soares, the Albany County district attorney, whose investigation last year of State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi's use of public employees as chauffeurs later prompted Mr. Hevesi to resign and plead guilty to a corruption charge. The two discussed collaborating on corruption cases, which could give muscle to Mr. Soares's efforts to pursue investigations despite his skeleton staff.
Later in the day, the attorney general sat down with David Grandeau, the executive director of the state lobbying commission, which has led several investigations of lobbyists and their work with state elected officials, including Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican leader of the State Senate.
''Governor Spitzer laid out a vision yesterday, and part of that vision is restoring public trust and focusing on public integrity issues,'' Mr. Cuomo said, speaking after his meeting with Mr. Soares. ''It's a mandate that we spoke about jointly during the campaign, and the issue of public integrity is now a front-burner issue.''
Yesterday's meetings were intended to position Mr. Cuomo, a card-carrying member of the state's political establishment and the son of a former governor, as Mr. Spitzer's fellow crusader for reform.
But Mr. Cuomo's decision to emphasize public corruption issues so early represented a contrast of sorts to Mr. Spitzer, who rose to national repute during his own tenure as attorney general through his aggressive prosecutions of corporate malfeasance, rather than prosecutions of official corruption.
After the Hevesi case resulted in the comptroller's guilty plea, Mr. Soares said his office was flooded with tips about wrongdoing. But his office has relatively few resources to prosecute them: just two lawyers -- one of them currently on leave -- and one investigator. Last December, as Mr. Soares was investigating Mr. Hevesi, the County Legislature eliminated the job of Mr. Soares's chief investigator.
Appearing with Mr. Cuomo after yesterday's meeting, Mr. Soares said they discussed the possibility of having Mr. Cuomo's investigators and lawyers work more closely with Mr. Soares and his staff.
''We are in discussions regarding collaboration and how we can share resources instead of spending more taxpayer dollars to reinvent the wheel,'' Mr. Soares said. ''There are resources that they have on the state side that we do not have here on the county side.''
He added that ''state lawmakers who have run afoul of the law should worry about our collaboration,'' though he hastened to add that most state legislators ''do good work, and they keep the public trust.''
Asked whether his office would act to recover some $500,000 in state grants directed by Mr. Bruno to a for-profit technology company in which a friend of Mr. Bruno's is an investor, Mr. Cuomo said he would not discuss any specific matters that might come before his office.
''As a general matter, money that has been misspent should be recovered,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''If the taxpayers' money was misspent, then we'll recover the money.''
During their meeting, Mr. Grandeau, the head of the lobbying commission, and Mr. Cuomo chiefly discussed Project Sunlight, a proposal Mr. Cuomo made during his campaign to unify five public disclosure databases into a single, improved database maintained by his office. The five databases cover pending legislation, contributions to elected officials, lobbyist registrations, state contracts, and businesses based in the state.
''It was something that I found very intriguing, as someone who has spent the last twelve years trying to keep track of what's going on in Albany,'' Mr. Grandeau said.
Mr. Cuomo's idea has already earned some support from some of the state's watchdog groups, which staged their own news conference yesterday to propose a set of sweeping new ethics laws. Among them were the creation of an independent ethics commission covering all state officials and employees; full and prompt disclosure of spending on legislators' pet projects, known as member items; and tighter restrictions on the use of campaign money for personal use.
''You're not going to have good-government groups applauding incremental change'' this year, said Blair Horner, the legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research Group.

Gov. Eliot Spitzer will call for the state government to ''rein in spending,'' cut property taxes and overhaul the workers' compensation system in his first address to state lawmakers on Wednesday.
His speech, or at least excerpts that his staff released on Tuesday, focused more on the economy than the inaugural speech he delivered on Monday, which more generally addressed the need for a ''new brand of politics'' in a state government mired in gridlock and scandal.
Gov. Eliot Spitzer’s speech will focus more on the economy than the inaugural speech, according to excerpts.
Gov. Eliot Spitzer will call for the state government to ''rein in spending,'' cut property taxes and overhaul the workers' compensation system in his first address to state lawmakers on Wednesday.
His speech, or at least excerpts that his staff released on Tuesday, focused more on the economy than the inaugural speech he delivered on Monday, which more generally addressed the need for a ''new brand of politics'' in a state government mired in gridlock and scandal.
According to the excerpts, Mr. Spitzer plans to issue a call ''to rein in spending and exhibit fiscal restraint'' to better afford ''long-term investments for our future.''
''We must reverse the decline of our upstate economy, sustain the economic expansion downstate and develop new ways for those communities which have been left behind to share in the prosperity,'' according to the prepared remarks.
The speech will open a new legislative session. Among the other events of the day, the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, is expected to be re-elected temporary president of the Senate, despite a federal investigation of his outside business activities. Mr. Bruno is the state's most powerful Republican and will be a counterweight to the governor.
After a closed-door meeting on Tuesday with other Republican senators, Mr. Bruno said the investigation did not come up.
''We're not talking about that,'' he said. ''The people are pretty well informed as to what is going on, and, again, there isn't anything that we have been accused of, so were staying focused on our agenda.''
The only public dissenter among Senate Republicans, Senator John J. Bonacic, said he intended to vote against Mr. Bruno but conceded he did not know of any other senator who would do the same.
''As I see it, if our majority leader bleeds, the conference bleeds,'' he said.
Mr. Spitzer's staff also said on Tuesday that officials in his administration would prepare an annual report on the upstate region to be issued on the day the governor delivers his annual addresses to the Legislature. They also reiterated many of the proposals they made during the campaign aimed at reviving the upstate region including expediting infrastructure projects like a new Peace Bridge, which connects Western New York and Canada, and ensuring that upstate towns have high-speed Internet access.
His plan to cut property taxes will also be felt upstate. His first budget, due on Feb. 1, will include ''the first installment'' of the three-year, $6 billion property tax cut plan he laid out during his campaign. That plan includes a $1.5 billion property tax cut for the fiscal year beginning in April, a cut specifically aimed at the middle class.
''The fundamental problem with the current system is that it doesn't care whether or not a person can afford to pay their property taxes,'' Mr. Spitzer said in the speech excerpts. ''Thus, the millionaire gets the same tax cut as the middle-class homeowner. I hope together we can fix this flaw.''
The prepared remarks have Mr. Spitzer saying, ''Property tax cuts and increased support for education must be considered in tandem,'' a nod to the Republican-controlled Senate on property taxes and to the Democratic-led Assembly on education.
In a sign of his desire to improve the business climate upstate, Mr. Spitzer will call for an overhaul of the workers' compensation system, which he also made a priority during his campaign. Unlike many states, New York does not limit how long injured workers can receive payments for certain kinds of injuries, including head and back injuries.
Executives like Robert S. Miller, the chairman and chief executive of the auto supply giant Delphi, have criticized the state for high costs related to workers' compensation. On the other hand, unions do not like the system either, because the maximum weekly payment of $400 has not been raised in recent years.
In his prepared remarks, Mr. Spitzer calls workers' compensation ''a system that does not work for anyone, not the employers who pay some of the highest premiums in the country and not the workers who receive some of the lowest benefits.''
He said that the government must reduce costs that are too high for businesses and citizens -- the ''perfect storm of unaffordability.''
And as he did in his inaugural speech, he plans to lay blame at the feet of his predecessor, George E. Pataki, and perhaps to some extent at the other two men who have run the state for more than a decade, Mr. Bruno and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat.
''We are operating in a deficit environment inherited from a culture that failed to make hard choices,'' the remarks quote him as saying. ''We're in this position because of a lack of leadership.''

A man accused of fatally shooting the owner of a beauty salon here had been hired by a companion she was trying to break up with, the police said on Tuesday.
The companion, Patrick Bowie, 45, of Middletown, tried to kill himself before he was arrested, the police said.
A man accused of fatally shooting the owner of a beauty salon in Middletown, N.Y., had been hired by a companion she was trying to break up with, the police said.
A man accused of fatally shooting the owner of a beauty salon here had been hired by a companion she was trying to break up with, the police said on Tuesday.
The companion, Patrick Bowie, 45, of Middletown, tried to kill himself before he was arrested, the police said.
Mr. Bowie and the man accused of pulling the trigger, Melvin Green, 35, of the Bronx, were charged in the murder of Fermina Nunez, 36, who was shot in the back of the head late Saturday at the salon, said Lt. Paul Rickard of the Middletown Police Department.
Mr. Bowie, who had had an off-and-on relationship for seven years with Ms. Nunez, a mother of four, hired Mr. Green to go to the salon, on Wickham Avenue, and kill her, Lieutenant Rickard said. He would not say how much money was involved.
''There was no other factor involved other than she was trying to get out of a relationship,'' Mr. Rickard said.
As detectives waited for a search warrant outside Mr. Bowie's house on Tuesday morning, he stabbed himself in the neck and groin and slit a wrist with a kitchen knife, the police said. He then walked outside and surrendered.
He was taken to Orange Regional Medical Center in Middletown, where he was arraigned on a charge of first-degree murder, Lieutenant Rickard said. He was then taken to the Westchester County Medical Center, where he was listed in serious condition.
Mr. Green, who the police said had been a friend of Mr. Bowie's for 20 years, was taken into custody in the Bronx on Monday night and brought to Middletown for questioning. While he was being driven to Orange County, Middletown detectives, along with the New York State and New York City police, searched his apartment and found a gun, Lieutenant Rickard said. Mr. Green was charged with first-degree murder and robbery and was being held at the Orange County Jail without bail, the authorities said.
According to the police, Mr. Green entered the Final Touch by Fermina beauty salon just before midnight on Saturday as Ms. Nunez was doing the hair of three customers who were getting ready for New Year's. He forced the women to lie face down and demanded that Ms. Nunez tell him how to open the cash register. When he could not do it himself, Ms. Nunez opened the register for him. He then shot her in the head, taking money from the register before he fled, Lieutenant Rickard said.
Detectives think Mr. Bowie was outside the shop at the time of the killing, Lt. Patrick Freeman of the Middletown police said.
The police said they began investigating Mr. Bowie because of his relationship with Ms. Nunez. There were several occasions in which the police were called to their homes, though no arrests were made, Lieutenant Rickard said. The inquiry led to Mr. Green, who matched the description of the gunman given by a witness, the police said.
Though the gunman demanded money, Lieutenant Rickard said, detectives suspected that robbery was not the motive because there were gas stations in the area that would have had more cash and because the killer seemed to know that Ms. Nunez was working late.
''We knew right off the bat the robbery was unusual and something else was going on,'' he added.
Both Mr. Bowie and Mr. Green have criminal records. Mr. Bowie was convicted of grand larceny in New York City in 1995. Mr. Green served three years in a New York State prison in the mid-1990s on a weapons conviction. He was also convicted of robbery and possession of a loaded firearm in New York in 1991, said Sgt. Jerry Mishk, a detective in the Middletown Police Department.
Outside Ms. Nunez's salon, a woman who identified herself as a relative of Ms. Nunez's said that Ms. Nunez had spoken of being stalked by Mr. Bowie.

156 <html><head><b><center>PANEL SEEKS END TO DEATH PENALTY FOR NEW JERSEY<center></b></head><p align="left">Legislative panel recommends that New Jersey become first state in 35 years to abolish death penalty, finding that capital punishment serves no legitimate purpose and that there is increasing evidence that it conflicts with 'evolving standards of decency'; 13-member panel issues report year after New Jersey joined Illinois and Maryland in suspending executions, and amid growing public disquiet about capital punishment; Gov Jon S Corzine welcomes report, which makes New Jersey first state to receive official recommendation that capital punishment be permanently abolished; panel cites polls that reflect growing opposition to death penalty; report draws criticism from Republicans and from panel's lone dissenter, who say fault is not with law but with judges and others who do not properly enforce existing law (M)
A legislative commission recommended on Tuesday that New Jersey become the first state to abolish the death penalty since states began reinstating their capital punishment laws 35 years ago. Its report found ''no compelling evidence'' that capital punishment serves a legitimate purpose, and increasing evidence that it ''is inconsistent with evolving standards of decency.''
The report, whose lone dissenter was the original author of the state's modern death penalty statute, came a year after New Jersey joined Illinois and Maryland in imposing moratoriums on executions, and amid growing unease among politicians and the public about capital punishment.
The recommendation would make New Jersey the first state in over 35 years to abolish the death penalty.
A legislative commission recommended on Tuesday that New Jersey become the first state to abolish the death penalty since states began reinstating their capital punishment laws 35 years ago. Its report found ''no compelling evidence'' that capital punishment serves a legitimate purpose, and increasing evidence that it ''is inconsistent with evolving standards of decency.''
The report, whose lone dissenter was the original author of the state's modern death penalty statute, came a year after New Jersey joined Illinois and Maryland in imposing moratoriums on executions, and amid growing unease among politicians and the public about capital punishment.
Eight other states, including New York, have also suspended executions in recent years, most because of court decisions. Maryland had lifted its moratorium in 2003, after a year, but a court essentially reinstated it last month.
Death penalty experts said that New Jersey was the first state to receive an official recommendation that capital punishment be abandoned, and it lands in a state where legislators have a Democratic majority along with a Democratic governor who supports repeal of the statute.
The governor, Jon S. Corzine, embraced the report on Tuesday. ''As someone who has long opposed the death penalty,'' he said in a statement, ''I look forward to working with the Legislature'' to carry out the recommendations.
There is ample opposition to capital punishment in both houses of the Legislature, and Senate President Richard J. Codey said in an interview that he expected to ask for a vote, although he would not discuss a timetable.
Assembly Speaker Joseph J. Roberts, who also said he supported an end to the death penalty, issued a written statement saying that he would not consider scheduling a vote until discussing the report with other Democrats, leaving the possibility that repeal legislation could remain locked in committee.
New Jersey's last execution was in 1963, and its death row population has shrunk to nine men. Many appeals have been extended for years by a process known as ''proportionality review,'' meant to assure that capital sentencing was not being arbitrarily applied, before the State Supreme Court.
The 13-member New Jersey Death Penalty Study Commission, including two prosecutors, a police chief, clergy members and murder victims' representatives, began meeting in June and heard from scores of witnesses at five public hearings before issuing the 127-page report.
''Based on our findings, the commission recommends that the death penalty in New Jersey be abolished and replaced with life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, to be served in a maximum security facility,'' the report said. ''The commission also recommends that any cost savings resulting from the abolition of the death penalty be used for benefits and services for survivors of victims of homicide.''
If the Legislature did abolish the death penalty, it would be the first to do so since the United States Supreme Court halted all executions in 1972 -- after which 38 states rewrote their laws to reinstate the practice. New Jersey restored the death penalty in 1982.
But a repeal would be in line with a nationwide retreat from executions, with the annual count declining by nearly half since 1999. A nationwide Gallup telephone poll in 2006 found Americans almost evenly divided when asked whether a death sentence or life without the possibility of parole was a preferable punishment for murder, after years of previous polls in which a majority supported the death penalty.
''We're in a period of national reconsideration of the death penalty,'' said Austin D. Sarat, a professor of political science and law at Amherst College in Massachusetts. ''I believe what's happening in New Jersey will have a tremendously galvanizing effect.''
Richard C. Dieter, the director of the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington, attributed the sea change to the many wrongful convictions exposed by DNA evidence. ''That is the wedge that has made the death penalty difficult to fix,'' Mr. Dieter said. ''It's all related to the scientific revolution we've had in the last 10 years.''
Professor Sarat, the author of the 2001 book, ''When the State Kills,'' said the shift in public opinion had accelerated even in the last few months.
Two weeks ago, a botched execution in Florida underscored doubts about lethal injection and led Gov. Jeb Bush to suspend the death penalty. The same day, a federal court ruled that California's lethal injection procedures violated the constitutional prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.
''If you'd asked me six months ago if they'd end up in this place, I'd have said no,'' Professor Sarat said of the New Jersey commission. ''I would have said they'd take a more careful route.''
New York, which has only one man on death row and has not carried out an execution since reinstating the death penalty, has had a moratorium since the state's Court of Appeals found its law unconstitutional in 2004. The Legislature has not moved to revise the statute.
In New Jersey, a bill to repeal the death penalty was introduced several years ago but never brought to a vote in the judiciary committee of either chamber. But Mr. Codey, the Senate president, said on Tuesday, ''I think that will be done.''
''What's the use of having a death penalty if at the age of 18 you commit a murder and then have to live longer than Methuselah to be executed?'' he asked.
Mr. Codey also pointed to the change in public opinion since the enactment of the death penalty law, as did the commission. The panel cited a 1999 Star-Ledger/Eagleton-Rutgers Poll in which 44 percent of New Jersey residents supported the death penalty and 37 percent preferred life imprisonment without parole, and a 2002 poll that asked the same question found that 36 percent supported the death penalty and 48 percent favored life without parole.
The commission's report, which recommended the life-without-parole alternative, drew stinging responses from several Republicans. ''How can they possibly arrive at that conclusion when New Jersey has not enforced the current law even once since its enactment?'' the Assembly's minority leader, Alex DeCroce, who represents Morris and Passaic Counties, asked in a written statement.
The dissenter on the commission, John F. Russo, a former State Senate president from Ocean County and a Democrat, said the problem was not in the law but in ''the liberal judges and other individuals who have consistently disregarded the legislative will and refused to enforce the law as written.''
Mr. Russo, a former prosecutor, recounted a death penalty verdict that he had fought for but left him in tears. ''I realize the gravity of the issue,'' he said, adding that he believed the death penalty should still be available in cases of serial killings and terrorism.

President Bush said on Tuesday that he would propose a plan that he insists would, if followed, achieve a balanced budget by 2012, the most optimistic he has been in at least five years, and he said the goal could be achieved without rescinding any of his big tax cuts.
In an op-ed article for the Wednesday issue of the The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Bush said his budget proposal for the 2008 fiscal year would for the first time project a deficit that disappears.

President Bush said on Tuesday that he would propose a plan that he insists would, if followed, achieve a balanced budget by 2012, the most optimistic he has been in at least five years, and he said the goal could be achieved without rescinding any of his big tax cuts.
In an op-ed article for the Wednesday issue of the The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Bush said his budget proposal for the 2008 fiscal year would for the first time project a deficit that disappears.
''The bottom line is tax relief and spending restraint are good for the American worker, good for the American taxpayer, and good for the federal budget,'' Mr. Bush said in the article, which was online Tuesday night. ''Now is not the time to raise taxes on the American people.''
Mr. Bush offered no specifics on how he intends to achieve a balanced budget, beyond declaring that his tax cuts had led to economic growth and generated large increases in tax revenue for the past two years.
The White House's most recent budget forecast, issued last summer, called for the deficit to decline to $127 billion in 2011 from its peak of $412 billion in 2004. Thanks to larger-than-expected revenue gains last year, the shortfall for 2006 declined to $248 billion.
During his re-election campaign in 2004, Mr. Bush promised to cut the deficit in half by 2009. Though the prediction was greeted with widespread skepticism, that goal now looks increasingly plausible even if war costs in Iraq continue at current levels for another year.
Mr. Bush gave no hint in the article about whether the goal of a balanced budget by 2012 was predicated on continued rapid growth in tax revenues or deep new spending cuts in domestic programs.
But Mr. Bush's budget plans in the past several years have consistently failed to take into account two major costs in the years ahead: the war in Iraq and the cost of restraining or repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax.
War costs are now more than $100 billion a year, and Mr. Bush is expected to ask Congress for a supplemental spending package of more than $110 billion to finance military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan over the next year.
The alternative minimum tax is a potentially more costly item. The tax, which was created to prevent rich taxpayers from making too much use of elaborate deductions, is rapidly expanding its reach into the middle class because it is not adjusted for inflation.
Mr. Bush and Democratic leaders have called for a permanent ''fix'' to the alternative minimum tax, but an outright repeal would cost about $1 trillion over the next 10 years. For the past several years, Mr. Bush and the Congress have kept the tax from expanding by passing a series of one-year measures that could cost more than $70 billion for next year alone.

Teddy Kollek, who as mayor of Jerusalem for nearly three decades did more to build and develop the city as Israel's capital than any other figure while promoting coexistence with a sometimes hostile Arab population, died Tuesday in Jerusalem. He was 95.
The Jerusalem Foundation, the fund-raising organization he established, announced his death.
Teddy Kollek served as mayor from 1965 to 1993 and worked to develop the city as Israel’s capital and unite its two halves.
Teddy Kollek, who as mayor of Jerusalem for nearly three decades did more to build and develop the city as Israel's capital than any other figure while promoting coexistence with a sometimes hostile Arab population, died Tuesday in Jerusalem. He was 95.
The Jerusalem Foundation, the fund-raising organization he established, announced his death.
Mr. Kollek, a former aide to David Ben-Gurion, Israel's founding prime minister, became mayor of small, Jewish West Jerusalem in 1965 and nearly resigned after a difficult first year. But after Israel conquered the city's eastern sector in the 1967 war, he threw himself into the project of a reunited Jerusalem and was re-elected five times before losing in 1993, at age 82, to Ehud Olmert, now the prime minister.
Mr. Olmert always chafed at Mr. Kollek's reputation as an indefatigable fund-raiser, institution builder and preacher of coexistence, but he praised him on Tuesday, saying, ''His name will always be an inseparable part of Jerusalem's glory.''
The late Yitzhak Rabin called him the greatest builder of Jerusalem since Herod the Great. Mr. Kollek was a founder of significant markers of the modern city and state: the Israel Museum, the Jerusalem Foundation, the Jerusalem Theater, the Cinemathèque, the Kahn Theater and other cultural institutions.
Uri Lupolianski, the current mayor, said Tuesday, ''Teddy was Jerusalem and Jerusalem was Teddy.'' It was a high compliment from a leader of the city's ultra-Orthodox community, with whom Mr. Kollek sometimes fought.
Mr. Kollek was a man of will, charm and energy who loved being a friend of the rich and the famous, including Elizabeth Taylor and Frank Sinatra. He tapped many of them for money for his beloved city.
He was above all a Labor Zionist who set about trying to unite the two halves of Jerusalem the best he could. ''He'd say, 'I'd love the city to be empty of Arabs, but since they are here we need to serve them, because if we treat them badly they will hate us more,''' said Tom Segev, an Israeli historian who ran Mr. Kollek's office for two years in the late 1970s.
Within hours of the takeover of East Jerusalem, Mr. Kollek went to the military commander and demanded milk for Arab children. ''He was the symbol of the unification of Jerusalem, and he was considered pro-Arab,'' Mr. Segev said. ''But he was simply pragmatic.''
Mr. Kollek felt he should have done more for Arab residents, said Yisrael Kimche, an urban planner. ''He himself said he did not do enough for East Jerusalem,'' Mr. Kimche said. ''He did not bring equality in city services between east and west. He tried, but not hard enough.''
In 1967, Mr. Kimche said, ''the gap between east and west was vast.''
''Three times a week there would be running water in the east,'' he said. ''Many neighborhoods there did not have sewage or phone lines. Eventually needs were mostly met, but there was never a budget large enough to cope.''
Meron Benvenisti, who worked closely with him, said Mr. Kollek saw Jerusalem ''in terms of Vienna, a mosaic of different cultures where the tension is benign, invigorating, not threatening to destroy the city.'' But what Mr. Kollek called heterogeneous, others, like Mr. Benvenisti, called dangerously polarized.
Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem has not been recognized internationally, and the 190,000 Jews who moved into it are considered illegal settlers by much of the world. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state.
In his 28 years as mayor Mr. Kollek worked 18-hour days, prowling the city and keeping his home phone number in the public directory. He would often return home to a pile of messages taken by his wife, Tamar. Sometimes he would return the calls, even at 3 a.m., telling people that he would get their problems fixed.
After 1993 he devoted much of his time to the Israel Museum and to the Jerusalem Foundation, which he set up in 1966 to raise millions of dollars in private financing for city projects, including parks, sports facilities and the restoration of archaeological treasures.
''He really forged the landscape of modern Jerusalem as we know it, and he saw the museum as the jewel in that landscape,'' said James Snyder, the museum's director. ''The idea of this modernist museum complex on the crest of Jerusalem was his.''
Mr. Kollek will be buried Thursday in a state funeral in a section of Mount Herzl Cemetery here reserved for Israel's leaders.
He was born Theodor Herzl Kollek on May 27, 1911, in a small village near Budapest and named after the Viennese founder of the Zionist movement. He grew up in Vienna, where his father was a director of the Rothschild bank.
''I came from a multiracial society,'' Mr. Kollek once recalled in an interview.
By the age of 11 he was already a Zionist, and as the Nazis came to power he organized an underground to smuggle refugees into Palestine. He emigrated to Palestine in 1935 and helped found the Ein Gev kibbutz. That first year he contracted typhoid five times and suffered several bouts of malaria.
Still, he remembered life at Ein Gev as paradise. ''We came to an empty land, we started growing trees, fishing on the Galilee,'' he said. ''You saw your dreams materialize.''
In 1937 he married Tamar Schwartz, whom he had met in Vienna. They had two children, Amos, a filmmaker, and Osnat, an artist. His wife and children survive him, as do five grandchildren.
Mr. Kollek was sent to England in 1938 to work with a Zionist youth movement, but he spent most of his energy getting Jews out of Nazi-occupied countries. In 1939 he went to Vienna carrying British entry permits for Austrian Jews. There he met a Nazi who seemed like a minor clerk, and after 15 minutes the official agreed to release 3,000 Jewish children from concentration camps.
Mr. Kollek said he never saw the man again until 1961, when the ''clerk'' was brought to Israel to face the charge of crimes against humanity. It was Adolf Eichmann.
In England, Mr. Kollek met Ben-Gurion, who became his mentor. During World War II, Mr. Kollek said, it became clear that ''a country of our own was an absolute necessity to save the Jewish people from extermination.''
He made frequent trips to Cairo, where he met Jewish soldiers serving in the British Army and used his connections to smuggle British arms to Palestine, then under the control of Britain. He was later criticized for giving the British the names of 1,000 members of the Jewish underground whose terrorist tactics were meant to force the British out.
''I'm proud of it,'' he said later. ''I'd do it again. The Jewish Agency, our government at the time, was respectable and on the way to becoming a state. We had one large defense organization, the Haganah.
''There were splinter groups -- Stern, Irgun -- who killed, blew up the King David, hanged British sergeants,'' he added, referring to the Jerusalem hotel.
After World War II, Mr. Kollek was sent to New York, where he worked partly out of a telephone booth and partly out of an office over the Copacabana nightclub to arm the Jewish state-to-be for an expected invasion by Arabs.
As Israel neared statehood in May 1948, he helped smuggle weapons. In one day he raised a million dollars in Mexico City to buy airplanes. When Israel became independent, he headed the American desk in the Foreign Ministry, then went to Washington as minister in the Israeli Embassy.
Mr. Kollek was a founder of the modern Israeli foreign intelligence service. Throughout the 1950s he was a liaison between Israel and the fledgling Central Intelligence Agency. In 1956 he helped the C.I.A. obtain a copy of a secret speech that changed the course of the cold war. It was a denunciation of the Soviet leader Stalin, then dead three years, by his successor, Nikita S. Khrushchev.
A copy of the speech went from Poland to Israel to the director of central intelligence, Allen W. Dulles, who gave it to his brother, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, who leaked it to The New York Times. It was the first sign that Stalin's reign of terror might be over.
In 1952 Ben-Gurion summoned Mr. Kollek to Jerusalem to become director general of the prime minister's office. In 12 years Mr. Kollek became involved in everything from broadcasting to the Dead Sea Scrolls, from aid programs to desalination.
When Ben-Gurion left office, Mr. Kollek transferred his energies to the Israel Museum. He had nursed the idea from the early 1950s, when most of Israel's leaders considered a museum of art a luxury the young state could not afford. But he argued that if Israel needed to absorb immigrants and build its military power, ''it also needs expressions of culture and civilization.''
Ben-Gurion, then in retirement, urged his protégé to seek the mayor's office in Jerusalem. His son offered no encouragement. ''What will happen if you win?'' he asked. ''You'll be in charge of the garbage?''
When a coalition on the city council elected him mayor in 1965, he went to Jerusalem's best tailor and ordered smart olive-green uniforms for the sanitation inspectors.
''I got into this by accident,'' he said. ''I was bored. When the city was united I saw this as a historic occasion. To take care of it and show better care than anyone else ever has is a full life purpose. I think Jerusalem is the one essential element in Jewish history. A body can live without an arm or a leg, not without the heart. This is the heart and soul of it.''
Mr. Kollek never spoke perfect Hebrew -- or perfect German or perfect English -- Mr. Segev remembered. ''In some ways he remained an alien,'' Mr. Segev said. ''But Israel is a colorful mosaic, and there was also a place for a stone called Teddy Kollek.''

Sit in with a seventh-grade science class at Seth Low, a cavernous Brooklyn middle school, as paper balls fly and pens are flicked from desk to desk.

The teacher, Laura Lowrie, tries to demonstrate simple machines by pulling from a box a hammer, a pencil sharpener and then, to her instant remorse, a nutcracker -- the sight of which sends a cluster of boys into a fit of giggles and anatomical jokes.

Sit in with a seventh-grade science class at Seth Low, a cavernous Brooklyn middle school, as paper balls fly and pens are flicked from desk to desk.
A girl is caught with a note and quickly tears it up, blushing, as her classmates chant, ''Read it!'' The teacher, Laura Lowrie, tries to demonstrate simple machines by pulling from a box a hammer, a pencil sharpener and then, to her instant remorse, a nutcracker -- the sight of which sends a cluster of boys into a fit of giggles and anatomical jokes.
''It's the roughest, toughest, hardest thing to teach,'' Ms. Lowrie said of middle school. ''I'll go home and feel disappointed with what's going on and I'll try a different tactic the next day.'' As for the nutcracker, she sighed, ''I should have used a stapler.''
Driven by newly documented slumps in learning, by crime rates and by high dropout rates in high school, educators across New York and the nation are struggling to rethink middle school and how best to teach adolescents at a transitional juncture of self-discovery and hormonal change.
The difficulty of educating this age group is felt even in many wealthy suburban school districts. But it is particularly intense in cities, where the problems that are compounded in middle school are more acute to begin with and where the search for solutions is most urgent.
In Los Angeles, the new superintendent, David L. Brewer III, has vowed to transform middle schools as a top priority, and low-performing schools are experimenting with intensive counseling.
In Philadelphia and Baltimore, school systems are trying to make the middle school problem literally disappear, by folding grades six through eight into K-8 schools. In one Columbia, S.C., school district, all five middle schools have begun offering some form of single-sex classes, on the theory that they promote self-esteem and reduce distractions.
And middle schools across the five boroughs of New York City are experimenting with a grab bag of strategies, from adding special periods dedicated to organizational skills, to reducing the number of teachers that each student has. At the Brooklyn Secondary School for Collaborative Studies, in Carroll Gardens, which includes grades 6 through 12, school does not start until 9 a.m., because the principal, Alyce Barr, believes adolescents are by nature not morning people.
Middle schools, sometimes called intermediate schools, were created starting in the 1960s, after educators determined that seventh-through-ninth-grade junior high schools were excessively rigid and unattuned to adolescents' personal development. But now, a battery of standardized tests, some required under the No Child Left Behind law, are starkly illustrating that many of these sixth-through-eighth-grade schools are failing, also.
The most recent results of math and reading tests given to students in all 50 states showed that between 1999 and 2004, elementary school students made solid gains in reading and math, while middle school students made smaller gains in math and stagnated in reading.
In New York State, grade-by-grade testing conducted for the first time last year showed that in rich and poor districts alike, reading scores plunge from the fifth to sixth grade, when most students move to middle school, and continue to decline through eighth grade. The pattern is increasingly seen as a critical impediment to tackling early high school dropout rates as well as the achievement gap separating black and white students.
''If you don't get them hooked into school here, by the time they leave they're gone.'' said Barry M. Fein, the principal of Seth Low.
The troubles transcend test scores. While 74 percent of elementary schools reported at least one violent incident in the 2003-4 school year, 94 percent of middle schools did, federal statistics show.
Mr. Fein spent a recent evening counseling a student who had used a blunt kitchen knife to slash her face and arms: Her wavering self-esteem, it seemed, had ebbed to a low after two friends went out to lunch at McDonald's without her.
''You handle stuff like that and you go, 'O.K., now you want me to raise test scores?' '' he said. ''They don't really think past tomorrow.''
In New York City, almost every kind of experiment is under way. At Intermediate School 211 in Canarsie, students of all grades are grouped into academies with themes like business and cultural arts based on their interests rather than their age. The principal, Buffie Simmons-Peart, confiscates explicit romance novels with airbrushed covers, saying they have a ''dumbifying'' influence.
I.S. 339, near Claremont Park in the Bronx, is working with Turnaround for Children, a nonprofit group, to focus on the most deeply troubled students, who can have an almost magnetic power over their peers. Nearly every seventh grader has a laptop computer -- an excellent antidote, the principal, Jason Levy, has found, to adolescents' fidgeting and demand for attention.
The city has also been experimenting with grade reconfiguration on a grand scale. Since 2004, the Bloomberg administration has converted 42 elementary schools into K-8 schools and closed 14 traditional middle schools, with plans to close eight more by 2008.
The city has also recently created 38 schools for grades 6-12, another twist on the middle school model. And 44 large middle schools have been carved into ''small learning communities,'' in which groups of students take their classes together, functioning almost as a school within a school.
Andres Alonso, the deputy chancellor for teaching and learning, said the department was also revisiting the way sixth through eighth graders are taught science and noted that it had added $40 million yearly for struggling middle school students. ''The work in the middle schools is extraordinarily important,'' Dr. Alonso said.
At Seth Low -- also known as I.S. 96 -- in the Bensonhurst neighborhood, Mr. Fein is skeptical of the rush for quick answers.
''Nobody's ever come down and said, 'This works,' '' he said, speaking amid an office cluttered with John Lennon memorabilia, congratulatory plaques and student work like a glittery card reading ''Mr. Fine, He So Fine.''
Mr. Fein worries about test scores because he has to; although some of his students take a special test to get in, his school is listed as failing under No Child Left Behind because it has narrowly missed performance targets for special education students, Hispanics and non-native English speakers. But scores are not exactly his priority.
One recent day, Mr. Fein rode in the back of a police car to a building where a runaway student was hiding out. He climbed to the sixth floor, where he found her, dried her tears and, when she was ready, escorted her down.
Another day, he spent hours arguing with superiors who insisted that a suspended student serve her time at a school in Park Slope, which the principal feared was so far away that the girl would never show up.
Still, Mr. Fein, 58, a former teacher who could have retired three years ago, sticks with it. To cope, he has taken to spending a few predawn minutes meditating in his office, to the glow of candles and a lava lamp.
Students also have to find ways to cope. For sixth graders like Atticus Rollins, 12, a video game and science fiction aficionado, the adjustment to middle school has been a strange mix of empowering and emasculating.
He likes being able to ''walk wherever you want in the hallways'' without having to follow a teacher ina straight line. Still, he said: ''It feels like you're in kindergarten again, because you're the youngest group of all. There are the tall eighth graders, they're like skyscrapers, you have to look up to them.''
For Raechelle Ellison, 11, transition was marked by tears, nightly pleadings to her mother that she did not want to return and the composition of poetry with verses like, ''Life in despair/I don't really care.''
''Being in middle school is just like a bird being kicked out of its nest by its mother,'' Raechelle mused in the cafeteria one recent morning.
At Raechelle's old school, nearly everyone was black, like her; at Seth Low, which has a mix of black, white, Asian and Hispanic students, she was initially the only black person in her class.
Last year, the private preK-8 school she attended was ''way smaller,'' and she spent most of the day in one classroom, with a single teacher. This year she shuffles from room to room, and it has taken her 10 teachers longer to figure out that her name is neither Rachel nor Rochelle but a unique blend of the two.
Raechelle, with her earnest reflections and pigtails, seems a world away from the eighth graders who rush into the cafeteria two periods later.
Robert Combs, 14, whose mind has already turned to high school and the eighth grade prom, listened to 50 Cent on his iPod. Nazli Sevuk, 14, sported a glittering ring from her boyfriend. Kimberly Basic, 13, with long, dark hair and snug jeans, plotted with friends about what to wear and how to meet up for a night out at a nearby nightclub's under-18 party; she can no longer be bothered with eighth grade boys.
Middle school teachers point to the gulf between the smooth-skinned sixth grade ''babies'' and these eighth-graders on the verge of adulthood, and note how they must guide these students through the profound transformations of adolescence.
''These kids go through more change in their lives than at any other time except the first three years,'' said Sue Swaim, executive director of the National Middle School Association.
The Seth Low seventh graders have their own theories about why middle school scores plummet.
Nadine George, 12, said she is struggling in science class now because she never understood it in elementary school, despite getting good grades on tests. ''Not that I knew how to do it, but whatever was in my notes I just copied it down,'' she cheerily elaborated.
Jeorge Coronado, 13, said he was distracted now by fights and girls, who were starting to ''look mad good.'' Fabiola Noel, 12, disclosed that during a recent math class, her mind wandered to the look of her hair. In the note that was torn up in science class, Lillian Safa, 13, had asked a friend why a third girl was ignoring her. Two weeks later, Lillian reported, they are once again friends.

172 <html><head><b><center>Luring Americans to Spain<center></b></head><p align="left">Long neglected as one of Spain's secondary cities, Valencia's role as host of the America's Cup this year and its ambitious efforts to showcase new architecture are enticing an increasing number of expatriates to visit the City of Oranges.
Britons and Germans have long been enchanted by the region, drawn by the Mediterranean coast, warm weather and the legendary expat enclaves of Benidorm and Alicante.
Long neglected as one of Spain's secondary cities, Valencia's role as host of the America's Cup this year and its ambitious efforts to showcase new architecture are enticing an increasing number of expatriates to visit the City of Oranges.
Britons and Germans have long been enchanted by the region, drawn by the Mediterranean coast, warm weather and the legendary expat enclaves of Benidorm and Alicante.
Increasingly Americans, too, are getting a taste for the region's attractions -- the number of visitors from the United States was up 12 percent in 2006 -- although most are content to rent rather than buy, according to Linda Rosell Casanova of Valencia Relocation, who has lived in the region for 36 years.
''The majority of Americans connected some way with the Cup are coming to stay for a year or two,'' she said. ''Others come for a cultural immersion, some to retire.'' U.S. citizens also are arriving to help run a new NATO base.
Mrs. Casanova actually advises interested Americans to rent for a time, so they can be sure they want to buy here before facing such hurdles as acquiring long-term visas.
One American who decided to just go ahead and buy is Joe Neira. Four years ago he sold the family home in Westchester County, north of New York City, to buy a villa in Valencia, ''mostly for the culture change.'' His wife, Lucrecia, was born in Valencia, and he speaks fluent Spanish, so the move was relatively painless, he said.
The couple and their two children have settled in a 40-year-old house with a swimming pool in the suburb of L'Eliana, about 15 minutes from the city center. They paid 800,000 euros, or $1.05 million, for the 450-square-meter, or 4,844-square-foot, five-bedroom home.
''We seem to have bought at the right time, before the rest of the world discovered that this was the last place in Europe where prices where going up,'' Mr. Neira said. ''People have just recently discovered that it's a kind of European Florida here, but with a classic European city on your doorstep, so it's now in demand.''
Mr. Neira points to what he calls the best climate in Europe -- locals say there are at least 300 days of sunshine a year -- and a city that is fast becoming an international center.
Some of the attention is due to the striking buildings designed by Santiago Calatrava, a native son. His City of Arts and Science project, an award-winning triumph of soaring beams and white steel domes hugged by blue lagoons, was built on one of the city's wastelands six years ago, and has helped put Valencia on the map in much the same way as Frank Gehry's Guggenheim draws crowds to Bilbao, Spain.
Also, ''investors saw it was cheap,'' Mrs. Casanova said. ''And money poured into the city in the last couple of years so there has been an artificial rise in prices.''
But in tandem with that growth, speculation -- and corruption -- has produced some urban and oceanfront blight.
Potential buyers also should be aware of Valencia's ''land grab'' rules. Basically, the local law, originally intended to prevent overdevelopment, has a loophole that allows developers to buy land or homes, whether the owners agree or not, and redevelop the property. In some cases, there has been no compensation at all.
The European Union has told Valencia to change the law. If there is no action soon, the case will be referred to the European Court of Justice.
Yet, overall, real estate prices are up 300 percent in the last five years, Mrs. Casanova said.
The average sale price of residential property is now 270,000 euros, or $355,000, said Graham Hunt, who runs the Valencia Property real estate agency and keeps a blog on Valencia property at valenciacomment.blogspot.com.
But the prices, at about 1,900 euros per square meter, or $228 per square foot, are a bargain compared with those in other Spanish cities, like Madrid's 3,717 euros per square meter ($446 per square foot) and Barcelona's 3,482 euros per square meter, ($418 per square foot).
Mr. Hunt said that, ''like the rest of Spain, price rises have slowed a lot in recent months.''
Many real estate experts have warned that Spain's market is seriously overvalued and, in an end-of-the-year assessment, Deutsch Bank's top market analyst noted that, in Europe, Spain is second only to Ireland in the likelihood of a property crash.
The Neiras, however, said they feel confident about their future in Spain -- evidenced by the effort they put into the renovation of their property.
Once they completed the purchase, they found themselves with a curious hacienda-in-Amsterdam hybrid of a villa (the previous owners had loved all thing Dutch), so they set about the hard task of renovating.
Mrs. Neira, a fashion designer and interior designer, took charge of the decor while Mr. Neira concerned himself with the building work. They spent tens of thousands of euros on stuccoing the interior walls alone, hiring a local artist to do it all by hand. ''He brought in his students -- mostly Spanish gypsies who worked between bouts of flamenco. It was quite a six months!'' he said.
Renovations totaled 200,000 euros, or about $263,000 -- a bargain compared to costs in the States, Mr. Neira said.
But Mrs. Casanova warned that not all builders can be as charming as their plasterers: ''Builders here need no license'' she said. ''So they could have been selling oranges last week, and most of them were.''
''You have to be on your guard,'' she said. ''A good lawyer, contact with an architect and good advice are essential.''

A FEW years ago, when I first glimpsed the azure wing of a bluebird in the hedgerow that borders my meadow, I could hardly believe my eyes.
Eastern bluebirds all but disappeared from my farm in central Maryland decades ago, their numbers reduced by pesticides and habitat loss. But now that farmers are cutting back their use of poisons and, thanks to government subsidies, turning some of their cropland into native grasses and trees, the bluebirds are coming back.
After a long absence, the bluebirds are back.
A FEW years ago, when I first glimpsed the azure wing of a bluebird in the hedgerow that borders my meadow, I could hardly believe my eyes.
Eastern bluebirds all but disappeared from my farm in central Maryland decades ago, their numbers reduced by pesticides and habitat loss. But now that farmers are cutting back their use of poisons and, thanks to government subsidies, turning some of their cropland into native grasses and trees, the bluebirds are coming back.
So are other birds. Just the other day, I was startled to see a pileated woodpecker drilling for insects in my old pear tree. Another day, a fat cinnamon-colored Carolina wren alighted on the railing outside my kitchen, chirping furiously.
And the bluebirds are no longer the shy denizens of the trees that edge the meadow. One pair, and then another, took up residence in the cavities of two old black locust trees that line the lane that passes by our loft, which was built out of an old haymow in the barn.
I was standing in the kitchen, looking out the window, when I noticed one of these birds flying down from the tree and across the field, with that curious dipping motion I've grown to recognize as that of a bluebird in flight. But there was something else that made me certain it must be a bluebird: It was one of those gestalt moments that birders talk about -- like that indefinable something that tells you that a figure walking on the beach in the distance is your brother, even though he is much too far away to see his face.
I thought I saw a flash of blue, too, but then again, I told myself, maybe that was wishful thinking. So I grabbed my binoculars, which I keep handy on the counter, and waited.
Two birds flew back up the field soon enough with that same dipping rhythm, and one of them landed on the broken branch of a locust tree about 30 feet from my kitchen window.
''Please, please, don't go away,'' I chanted as I clumsily tried to find the bird with the binoculars.
After several tries, I spotted him: a male bluebird with a satiny round head of the most sapphire blue and a rusty red breast, so close my heart was pounding.
I don't consider myself religious in any conventional sense. But that bluebird brought me closer to the sacred than I've ever been. Maybe it has something to do with loss and return.
At any rate, the male and his mate made their nest that spring in a cavity in one of the old trees. Another pair set up house in a different tree, about 50 feet away. Those black locusts, planted by my grandfather more than a hundred years ago, are full of hollows, perfect for bluebirds.
I watched the birds coming and going all spring, pecking insects out of the vegetable garden, as I turned over the cover crop and planted greens, sweet corn and huge patches of sunflowers and zinnias. By late summer, I was watching fuzzy fledglings teetering on the tall weeds growing up beneath the trees.
I realized that my various plantings over the years -- the roses, now laden with rose hips, the Alpine strawberries nestled in a nearby garden, the elderberry bushes next to the wild cedar and mulberry trees, the blackberry canes I let ramble, for their delicious fruit, in the old barnyard -- were beginning to accumulate into a bona fide bird habitat.
Just as important, the things I had never gotten around to doing -- cleaning up the brush pile, pruning the overgrown forsythia, pulling the wild grape out of the Gold Flame lonicera -- were enhancing that habitat.
All this mess was providing the wildlife with cover, insects, fruit and seeds. I kept meaning to cut back the poison ivy that scrambled up the locust trees again this summer, but it got away from me -- and produced a bumper crop of fruit for the birds.
When I decided not to mow the weeds beneath the locust trees, the birds feasted on the purple berries of the pokeweed, the seeds of the asters, foxtail, goldenrod, chickweed and Indian grass.
And thank goodness I didn't cut down the old pear tree.
''It's blocking your view of the curving fields,'' a landscape architect friend had pointed out last summer. ''And you never eat the fruit.''
It was true. It hadn't been pruned in years. The pears were full of worms.
''But the cardinals love to perch in the branches,'' I said.
And then, when this magnificent woodpecker showed up to feast on the insects in our neglected tree, I felt right with the world.
I looked up pileated woodpecker on my new favorite Web site, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology (www.birds.cornell.edu) by clicking on ''All About Birds'' and then ''Bird Guide,'' and selecting the name from the drop-down list.
There he was, my goliath: a 16- to 19-inch bird with a red crest and a white stripe extending beneath his eye and down his neck and black shoulders. He was probably eating ants, I learned from this site. And he and his mate would probably stay around all winter.
Then, I clicked on ''listen to the song of this species'' and was treated to a series of high-pitched squeaks that built to a crescendo, followed by the thunk-thunk-thunk sound of the drumming of his beak.
When I looked up Eastern bluebird, I was able to see that the juvenile's blue feathers are speckled with white. I had thought so, from my own observations last summer, but the little ones never sat still for long.
The Eastern bluebird's song is a series of musical whistles and ''dry chatter,'' as the guide puts it, and I played it over and over again, staring at the various pictures of male, female and juvenile. Next spring, when I hear that chatter, I may recognize it as a sign that the bluebirds have returned.
The Carolina wren, I was happy to find out, is here to stay.
It is possible to spend days on this Web site, not only learning the calls of birds and what they look like, but also watching videos -- of a robin eating berries in a cedar tree, for instance -- and surfing through cover-girl images of must-have shrubs for birds (bayberry, staghorn sumac, winterberry and viburnum).
What can I say? I'm in love with birds. I want to be able to recognize them by their calls when I'm walking through the woods. I want to plant everything they like, for food and shelter.
So be careful if you pick up a pair of binoculars and focus them clumsily on some blurry thing you think you see on a branch. You may lose yourself in a very different kind of garden from the one you thought you were making.

''Our guest is the stylish spendthrift,'' said Richard Born, a principal of BD Hotels, which also owns Manhattan hotels like the Maritime and the Mercer.
The Pod Hotel is the first of its kind to open in the United States, though capsule hotels have operated in Japan for more than two decades. The stripped-down easyHotel opened in London in 2005, and the chain has since spread through Europe and Asia.
Vanessa Guilford, the Pod Hotel's designer, has echoed transportation's efficient use of space. Bunk beds suggest sleeper cars on trains, and in rooms without bathrooms, a symbol above the door turns green when a shared hallway bathroom is vacant -- a detail borrowed from airplanes. Flip-down coat hooks are the same as those found on Amtrak trains.
''The idea was to keep it all cheap and cheerful,'' Ms. Guilford said, ''and to simplify it as much as possible.'' In the lounge, above right, a mural by James Rizzi sets the tone. The Pod Hotel is at 230 East 51st Street. For reservations, (212) 355-0300.

AS any architect knows, wedding vows are negotiable in the face of a design competition. Six months after Deborah Richmond and Olivier Touraine, architects in Los Angeles, married in 2001, they found themselves facing off on teams competing for the high-profile job of overhauling the grounds of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
''It was really difficult; it was really tense,'' said Mr. Touraine, who worked with a former boss, the flamboyant French architect Jean Nouvel, and shuttled for four months between France and California.

AS any architect knows, wedding vows are negotiable in the face of a design competition. Six months after Deborah Richmond and Olivier Touraine, architects in Los Angeles, married in 2001, they found themselves facing off on teams competing for the high-profile job of overhauling the grounds of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
''It was really difficult; it was really tense,'' said Mr. Touraine, who worked with a former boss, the flamboyant French architect Jean Nouvel, and shuttled for four months between France and California.
''It was really fun,'' said Ms. Richmond, who moved to Rotterdam in the Netherlands to work on Rem Koolhaas's team. ''It was like Deb's Big European Adventure.''
They talked by phone, but never about work. ''The atmosphere was like 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith,' '' she said, recalling the film about assassins told to kill each other. ''That movie was so close to our experience that we preordered tickets.''
The couple met in 1997, when he was working for Mr. Nouvel and she for Jon Jerde, the California master of mall design. The firms were designing parts of a commercial complex in Japan, and Ms. Richmond acted as translator and guide for Mr. Touraine and Mr. Nouvel when they visited the Jerde office here.
Eight months later Mr. Touraine, who is French, moved to Los Angeles, ostensibly for a job at the Southern California Institute of Architecture. ''I really moved here because of Debbie,'' he said.
The couple also started a firm here, Touraine Richmond Architects, and after the museum-grounds competition they settled back into working together. (The museum chose the Koolhaas plan, but abandoned it for lack of funds). They did a series of Los Angeles projects, including a home they converted from a 12-car garage in the Hollywood Hills for Wim Wenders, the filmmaker, and his wife, Donata.
Their latest collaboration is the so-called One Window House, a home they share with their 2-month-old son, Thomas. Once a backwater of tattoo parlors and beachside bodybuilders, Venice has become a percolating design district with a growing inventory of adventurous homes on narrow lots. Much of Frank Gehry's early work was in Venice, and he is building a highly anticipated home for himself three blocks south of the One Window House.
''This is a real laboratory,'' Ms. Richmond said, ''especially for young architects.''
Like other architects living here, Mr. Touraine, 43, and Ms. Richmond, 39, gravitated to Venice for its freedom: they could design what they liked without obeisance to a prevailing style. ''Context?'' Ms. Richmond said. ''What context? There's a bungalow here and stucco condo there.''
Architects also move here for the bargains (or did until a few years ago, when Venice real estate started to catch up with the rest of Los Angeles). In 2002 the couple paid $337,000 for a 3,900-square-foot plot and a two-story stucco house from 1951, which now contains a rental apartment and a studio for their firm.
They designed a second house for themselves and built it next door in 2005 for $410,000, or about $275 a square foot -- as opposed to $300 to $350 for typical architect-designed houses in the area -- largely by drawing on unconventional materials. A translucent plastic welding screen is used in place of a closet door, for example, and their fireplace is mounted in a black box built out of an inflammable material made of pressed paper.
''The materials create a certain lightness and thriftiness that richer materials would not impart,'' Ms. Richmond said.
On a recent morning they fed Thomas in the open living room as distinctive California light filtered through sage, alder and California myrtle visible through glass walls framing a 180-degree view. ''It's almost like our porch,'' Ms. Richmond said. ''We wave to our neighbors without leaving the couch.''
In fact, the couple consider the first-floor living area as much outdoors as indoors, a classic California sentiment. For all its light and views, the first floor does not have windows, only those walls of glass.
The openness gives way to utter privacy as you walk upstairs into a corrugated steel box with a compact labyrinth of rooms. In fact, the couple originally intended to build the No Window House, but in a last-minute concession to the ocean breeze they installed one horizontal strip in the master bedroom.

Dr. Leininger, 42, is one of thousands of Californians, many of them unlikely converts to the cause of alternative energy, who have installed solar power systems in their homes in just the last year.
Spurred by recent legislation that provides financial incentives -- and by rising energy costs and, perhaps, by a lingering distrust of power companies in the aftermath of the California electricity crisis at the start of the decade -- homeowners across the state have come to see solar power as a way to conserve money as well as natural resources. Architects in California are routinely designing solar systems into custom homes, and developers are offering solar systems and solar-ready wiring in new spec houses and subdivisions.
Solar power is also emerging as a kind of status symbol, a glamorous mark of personal responsibility. Celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Alicia Silverstone, Carlos Santana and Tom Seaver, have installed solar systems. (Edward Norton runs a campaign in Los Angeles, encouraging his fellow celebrities to install solar panels on their homes and to make donations for systems in low-income housing.)
The vogue began in earnest a year ago, when the state legislature approved the California Solar Initiative, one of the most ambitious solar programs in the world. The legislation took effect at the start of this month but was preceded by a stopgap measure with similar terms that ran throughout 2006, offering homeowners a rebate on top of the federal tax credit of up to $2,000 that has been available nationwide since 2006.
The theory was that supplanting the year-to-year incentive programs in place since 1998 with the long-term certainty offered by the initiative's 10-year, $3.2 billion program of rebates (one-third of which would likely go to homeowners) would stimulate the development of a robust solar sector -- which could then be weaned from subsidies as its growing scale brought down prices.
If it works as planned, said J. P. Ross, the policy director for Vote Solar, an organization that advocates for large state-level solar projects, the initiative will stimulate the installation of 3,000 megawatts of solar electrical generating capacity in the state over the next decade. That would be an increase by a factor of more than 20, Mr. Ross said, equivalent to 30 small natural-gas-fired power plants.
Given the enthusiasm homeowners have shown for the initiative, filing nearly twice as many plans for solar systems with the California State Energy Commission in 2006 than in previous years, this goal may not be far-fetched.
Other states are considering the future of their solar programs (several states in the Northeast and the Southwest have less ambitious ones in place, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut), and they are closely watching California's.
As the rebate program has made it less expensive to install a home solar system -- and as banks, which consider a solar system to be an improvement that increases a house's value, have made financing readily available -- the solar industry has grown. There are now 434 companies registered to install solar systems by the state energy commission, which together installed just under 50 megawatts of solar electric generating capacity in 2006, the most in a single year. (California's total capacity by October was 180 megawatts, enough energy to power about 135,000 homes. At the end of 2005 the nationwide solar photovoltaic capacity was 425 megawatts.)
While much of the total came from industrial and utility installations, more than 7,000 homeowners filed plans with the state energy commission in 2006, up from about 4,000 in each of the previous two years.
The companies are responding not only to an increase in demand, but also to a change in the type of consumers interested in going solar. Unlike the do-it-yourself tinkerers who once made up much of the home photovoltaic market, the people fueling the current growth spurt are interested in hands-off user friendliness.
''I more or less set it up and then I forgot about it,'' said Nicky González Yuen, an instructor in political science at De Anza College in Cupertino, who hired a company called NextEnergy to install the modest three-kilowatt system in his 100-year-old Berkeley duplex. ''I'm a really busy person, and I didn't need to know that level of information.''
Companies like NextEnergy provide homeowners with a complete package that includes system design, permit applications, rebate processing, installation, maintenance and warranty. ''It was a seamless, painless process,'' said Mr. Yuen, whose system cost $16,000 after the California rebate and the federal tax credit, which together saved him $10,000. It was ''comparable to having a sprinkler system put in,'' he said.
Mr. Yuen, 47, was the first on his block to install a solar system: ''In my circle I'm the eco-nut,'' he said. But, he said, less than a year later they are quite common in his neighborhood. ''A lot of people are really paying attention and beginning to think about the whole environmental cycle,'' he added.
But even as these solar adopters re-evaluate their relationship to the power grid, virtually all of them remain connected to it, which is contrary to the go-it-alone image of the early solar pioneers. Though the connection means a house will lose power in a blackout, most home users find the ease of operation makes up for the loss of independence.
''All I see is an e-mail from the system once a month,'' said Robert Felton, chief executive of TenFold, a software company, of the report of how much power his mansion in the Oakland hills is using and producing.
As recently as 10 years ago it was unheard of and, in fact, illegal for solar-powered houses in California to connect to the grid; now power companies are legally required to credit their customers for the excess power they produce.
The grid, in effect, serves to store power, replacing the bank of batteries that is a component of off-grid systems. At the end of the year, credits for solar power added to the grid are applied against charges for power taken from it, helping homeowners ''zero out'' their electricity bills. According to Borrego Solar Systems, the company that installed the long rows of solar panels on a hill next to Mr. Felton's house, two-thirds of its customers manage to do so.
Excess credits are lost at the end of the year, so homeowners, at least for now, cannot make a profit from their solar systems. Even so, the savings can be substantial: in 2005 Mr. Felton paid Pacific Gas and Electric about $2,500 a month for electricity. (''I have a whole bunch of fountains and water features and stuff like that,'' he said.) In California residential electricity rates are tiered, and large users like Mr. Felton pay rates about three times higher than more modest consumers, making solar power even more attractive.
While the average home solar system is about five kilowatts, Mr. Felton's is 45 kilowatts, and he seldom sees an electric bill. Borrego Solar estimated the system could save Mr. Felton almost $2 million over 30 years -- far more than the $255,000 the system cost him after a $134,000 rebate.
Mr. Felton, 67, said that a solar system did not make sense when he built his house in 2000, but that the rebate, as well as rising electricity prices, persuaded him to install the system last year. His pragmatic concerns were also informed by broader issues. ''I'm not a hippie greenie,'' he said, pointing out that with a background in nuclear engineering, he strongly supports nuclear power. ''But solar is certainly a way to get off foreign oil.''
As a member of the military who has been deployed to the Persian Gulf three times, Dr. Leininger has been affected by the nation's foreign oil habits more than most. ''The need for stable oil supplies is the big reason that we spend so much time in the Persian Gulf,'' he said. ''Decreasing our national energy consumption is in my self-interest.''
His neighbors in the San Diego suburb of Escondido, most of them politically conservative, have responded well to the solar panels of the eight-kilowatt system that he and his wife, Suzann, a cartographer, installed last year on their roof. The neighborhood association, which was required to approve the plan by California law, did so happily, he said. Lately, the Leiningers have noticed at least one other photovoltaic system in the immediate area and a number of solar heating systems for swimming pools. (Meanwhile, in Orange County, which is known for its political conservatism, about 250 solar installations were approved from January to November last year, more than twice the 2005 figure.)
The Leiningers, who paid Borrego Solar $39,000 for their system after a $24,000 rebate, figure their system will pay for itself in a dozen years -- assuming residential electricity rates do not increase, as they have by 37 percent since 1998. Dr. Leininger estimated that his system had reduced his household carbon emissions by nearly 30 tons since it was installed in June, and that it was well on its way to zeroing out.
''It comes down to personal responsibility,'' he said. ''If I can go electricity-neutral on my house, that's that much less coal we have to burn.''
And much less money. ''One of the most gratifying things is on a sunny day when the meter is spinning backward,'' Dr. Leininger said. ''We have a guaranteed return on the system because we know we're not going to have an electric bill from now on.''
Chasing Solar Power in the Northeast
HOME solar systems in the Northeast can produce up to 90 percent of the electricity generated by those in California, said Michael Hall, chief marketing officer for Borrego Solar Systems, a company in California. It is not surprising, then, that some California installers are expanding nationally. They include PowerLight and Akeena Solar, which opened offices in New Jersey in the last two years.
The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority's Web site, powernaturally.org, explains the state's incentive program, which has been in place since 2002. It covers 40 percent to 70 percent of the cost of a home system, depending on its size and other factors. State-approved installers are listed at the site as well.
New Jersey has been offering rebates to homeowners for photovoltaic systems since 2001, and it is now the second-largest solar market in the country. The state offers rebates up to $3.80 per watt for home systems. While this is less than New York's rate, New Jersey makes it possible for system owners to sell renewable energy credits and earn continuing revenues, unlike New York and most other states. Details and contact information for dozens of installers are at the New Jersey Clean Energy Program's Web site, njcep.com.
Connecticut's rebate program pays up to $25,000 per solar photovoltaic installation, depending on the components used and how they are configured. Information is at ctinnovations.com/funding/ccef/solar--rebates.php.

IT has been more than five years since the first of Ann Brashares's ''Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants'' novels, which would become a sensation among teenage girls, hit the best-seller list. The last book in the series, ''Forever in Blue: The Fourth Summer of the Sisterhood,'' will be published on Tuesday, but during that half decade, the characters have aged only about three years.
To anyone who knows Ms. Brashares and her husband, Jacob Collins, a portrait painter, that lag makes perfect sense. Mr. Collins, too, seems to slow time to suit his purposes: He paints in the classical tradition, using centuries-old techniques to create works that could have been produced hundreds of years ago.
An author dreams up those well-traveled pants while the children and an art school are downstairs.
IT has been more than five years since the first of Ann Brashares's ''Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants'' novels, which would become a sensation among teenage girls, hit the best-seller list. The last book in the series, ''Forever in Blue: The Fourth Summer of the Sisterhood,'' will be published on Tuesday, but during that half decade, the characters have aged only about three years.
To anyone who knows Ms. Brashares and her husband, Jacob Collins, a portrait painter, that lag makes perfect sense. Mr. Collins, too, seems to slow time to suit his purposes: He paints in the classical tradition, using centuries-old techniques to create works that could have been produced hundreds of years ago.
His style is so out, it may be in again. As the ringleader of a group of youngish painters devoted to classical techniques, Mr. Collins was recently named one of the art world's most powerful people by Art & Auction magazine, and lately his paintings have been selling for as much as $125,000. Writing about him, the magazine noted that ''although many attempt to buck modernism's strong attraction, only the truly powerful -- and talented -- can pull it off.''
Mr. Collins, 42, runs a school of classical painting, called the Water Street Atelier, out of the house he and Ms. Brashares, 39, share with their three children, Susannah, 5, Nate, 8, and Sam, 11. Students -- about a dozen at a time -- spend four years studying with Mr. Collins, working long hours that begin when the first model begins posing at 8:30 each morning. The students sometimes share meals with the family, walk the dog and baby-sit for the children. And the children occasionally pose in the studio, usually while watching videos, a not-very-classical technique to help them sit still.
For years the couple tried to accommodate both their growing family and Mr. Collins's studio and art school in a Brooklyn brownstone, while Ms. Brashares worked as an editor at 17th Street Productions, a packager of teen novels. At one point, with the ménage bursting at the seams, Mr. Collins rented a studio in Dumbo. But in 2000, the couple began looking for a building big enough to accommodate both home and studio, with separate entrances. ''We were pretty flexible about geography, because the requirements for the building were so specific,'' Ms. Brashares said.
A broker directed them to a four-story building in the East 60s that had been built as a carriage house but for years had housed the Sculpture Center, a school and gallery. Essentially an industrial space -- the sculptors had been using it for welding and stone-carving -- it had no living quarters at all, which is why it was a bargain, the couple said (although they declined to say how much they paid for it). They had profited from the sale of their Brooklyn house and had enjoyed ''a small windfall'' when 17th Street, of which Ms. Brashares was a part-owner, was sold. Still, they said, they borrowed to the hilt to buy the building.
They hired Fairfax & Sammons, a Manhattan firm known for classical architecture, to renovate the 25-foot-wide, 100-foot-deep building. Richard Sammons, a partner in the firm, began by leaving the ground floor studio pretty much as he found it, with 15-foot ceilings and a black terrazzo floor. (It is so big that the couple can park their car inside without disturbing the students.) On the upper levels, about 4,000 square feet in all, Mr. Sammons created new interiors that look as if they had been there forever, thanks to features like leaded-glass windows.
The architectural details are far less lavish than in many Fairfax & Sammons houses, like a grandiose 60,000-square-foot mansion that the firm is currently completing in Palm Beach. At around $500 a square foot for construction, Mr. Collins said, ''our budget was too low'' for ostentation. The house's beauty lies in its proportions. The kitchen is nearly a perfect square, as is the library, with the result that you feel properly situated the moment you walk into either room.
The layout, though, is far from traditional. First, the couple asked Mr. Sammons to dispense with a dining room. Ms. Brashares, who grew up with three brothers and no sisters in a series of houses around Washington, D.C., said, ''We always had a big dining room that nobody went into.'' Instead, Mr. Sammons turned the back of the house into a 25-by-25-foot kitchen, with multiple work areas for adults and children. In the library at the front of the house, several shelves are filled with candy-colored foreign editions of the ''Traveling Pants'' books, in more than 30 languages. A stair in the large central hall leads to an upper level with four bedrooms. From there, another stairway ascends to Ms. Brashares's office, alone on the top floor, her haven.
''I'm careful not to bring household stuff up there,'' she said. ''I arrange the play dates in the kitchen; I pay the bills in the kitchen.'' She writes, mostly at night, on a tiny laptop, surrounded by several of Mr. Collins' paintings -- just a few of the more than 100 of his older works that cover the walls of the house.
Ms. Brashares and Mr. Collins met when she was just 18. At the time, he was a junior at Columbia, and she was a freshman at Barnard; his father, Arthur Collins, was one of her philosophy professors. During their first encounter, in the library, he sketched her portrait.
In the early years of their marriage, Ms. Brashares worked as an editorial assistant, and then an editor, while Mr. Collins, who had attended the New York Academy of Art, honed his technique. In 1999, after hearing a colleague describe how she had once shared a pair of pants with friends, Ms. Brashares began working on a book about four teenage girlfriends who spend their summers apart, but stay in touch in part by taking turns wearing the same magical jeans, which somehow fit each of their bodies.
Published in September 2001, ''Traveling Pants'' was an immediate success. There are now 7 million copies of the books in print in North America alone, according to Noreen Marchisi, a spokeswoman for Random House, Ms. Brashares's publisher. (This despite the fact that Ms. Brashares tells parents not to buy the books for children under 12, who she thinks may not be ready for the mild sexual content.)
She has just completed her first novel for adults, about a group of friends in their early 20s, called ''The Last Summer (of You & Me).'' It will be published in June. She decided to end the ''Traveling Pants'' series with the latest book, ensuring through a plot twist that the series cannot be revived (though ''it's not like I kill off any of the characters,'' she said).
Although she could easily have extended the series, and the considerable income it generated, Ms. Brashares said that she was ''ready to move on.'' In any case, she added, all that money came too late to contribute to the high cost of the house and its renovation, beyond a few antiques and a ''somewhat old rug'' for the center hall.
''I remember thinking: I wish I'd known the book would succeed, because I would have tiled our bathroom,'' she said.

A favorite sport in today's bloated art world is to lament the surfeit of commercial galleries, biennials and art fairs, which have replaced the ''genuine'' art experience provided by nonprofit organizations. But as Matthew Higgs, director of White Columns, the city's oldest alternative art space, recently pointed out in Artforum, the nonprofit scene in New York is thriving.
Mr. Higgs's examples -- Artists Space, the Kitchen, Printed Matter -- fall mostly within Chelsea and Lower Manhattan. To his list you might add the Longwood Arts Project in the Bronx. Founded in 1981 by the Bronx Council on the Arts, the project has welcomed residents including Ernesto Pujol, Pepón Osorio and Tim Rollins & Kids of Survival (K.O.S.). Longwood also maintains, perhaps more than any other alternative art space in the city, a tangible relationship with its surroundings.
“South Bronx Contemporary: Longwood Arts Project’s 25th Anniversary” looks back at the nonprofit’s history as part of the South Bronx cultural landscape.

Mr. Higgs's examples -- Artists Space, the Kitchen, Printed Matter -- fall mostly within Chelsea and Lower Manhattan. To his list you might add the Longwood Arts Project in the Bronx. Founded in 1981 by the Bronx Council on the Arts, the project has welcomed residents including Ernesto Pujol, Pepón Osorio and Tim Rollins & Kids of Survival (K.O.S.). Longwood also maintains, perhaps more than any other alternative art space in the city, a tangible relationship with its surroundings.
''South Bronx Contemporary: Longwood Arts Project's 25th Anniversary'' at the project's gallery space consists of three installations put together by former Longwood directors: Fred Wilson, Betti-Sue Hertz and Eddie Torres.
Longwood's position as an art world entity and part of the South Bronx cultural landscape is immediately apparent in Ms. Hertz's installation, ''Street Disturbance.'' Excerpts from William Pope.L's ''Black Factory'' project include a vitrine of objects like a James Brown doll and a melted hair pick labeled as if it were crime-scene evidence and a video in which Mr. Pope.L enlisted masked participants to approach people at a fair in Maine and ask them about race.
Included in this section are the Surveillance Camera Players, who use similar agitprop tactics in their videos, posing masked in front of surveillance cameras holding signs reading ''1984'' or ''Big Brother.'' Etcétera, an Argentine collective, videotapes its performances, which look like soccer rallies but involve pointing out the homes of suspected torturers during the ''Dirty War,'' the deadly civil conflict that took place in Argentina from 1976 to 1983.
''Iconoclasm,'' organized by Mr. Torres, takes a lighter approach, simply celebrating the Bronx's cultural diversity. Dylan Mortimer's ''Prayer Booth,'' a copy of an aluminum phone booth outfitted with a pull-down knee rest, and his ''Portable Kneeler'' with red and yellow construction-site graphics, are similarly playful -- paying homage to, and spoofing, the religious art of this heavily Hispanic and Roman Catholic borough.
A wall hung salon-style with paintings, drawings and photographs continues Mr. Torres's Bronx-centric view of art and culture. Some of the lopsided portraits found here look frankly amateurish, like the paintings found in thrift stores. But there are also Olga Kitt's canny rendering of ''Van Gogh's 'Starry Night' as a Graffiti'' and her Picasso redux, ''Demoiselles Da Bronx.'' A video of the drag queen Princess Xtravaganza performing and Sally DeJesus' remake of the board game Monopoly with South Bronx streets add to this roundup of local-inflected art.
The tightest installation in the show, ''Black Now,'' is the work of Longwood's first director, Mr. Wilson. An artist known for his critiques of institutions and of accepted versions of history, he treats ''Black Now'' as a curatorial outing and an unannounced exhibition of items from his own collection. Interspersed among works by Kara Walker, Kalup Linzy and Rashawn Griffin are vitrines filled with objects -- everything from black ceramic panthers and dark-skinned Nativity figures to black light bulbs, Black perfume by Kenneth Cole and black pasta (squid-ink pasta).
Walls are lined with T-shirts for bands like Black Flag and Black Maria, and a grid of wall-mounted DVD boxes features titles like ''Black Hawk Down,'' ''Black Orpheus,'' ''Black Beauty'' and ''Men in Black.''
Mr. Wilson's own contribution pretty much steals the show in this installation, although Carl Pope's letterpress posters, filled with proclamations like ''Black makes me feel thin'' and ''Black is Beauty, Pride, Power. Black is Me!,'' reveal a similar semantic intelligence.
Longwood's mission, to nurture unknown talent, especially ''underrepresented groups such as people of color and women,'' can feel at times like revisiting the early '90s, when identity politics were as much a genre of contemporary art as portraiture or landscape painting were in the 19th century. Today, when the trend is toward emerging artists from around the globe, Longwood feels even more anchored in its neighborhood.
''South Bronx Contemporary: Longwood Arts Project's 25th Anniversary'' continues through March 10 at Longwood Art Gallery, Hostos Community College, 450 Grand Concourse, at 149th Street, Mott Haven, the Bronx; (718) 518-6728 or longwoodcyber.org.
ART REVIEW
Correction:  January 9, 2007, Tuesday  An art review on Thursday about the exhibition ''South Bronx Contemporary: Longwood Arts Project's 25th Anniversary,'' at Hostos Community College in the Bronx, omitted a curator. The wall of art hung salon-style was organized by Edwin Ramoran under the title ''Everyday Is Like Sunday''; it is not part of ''Iconoclasm,'' organized by Eddie Torres and hanging in the same room.
A picture caption with the review misstated the given name of a former director of the Longwood Arts Project who is also one of the curators of the show. As noted in the review, he is Fred Wilson, not Frank.

Auction frenzy is gripping the art world and in response hundreds of new sellers in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai are putting contemporary experimental artworks on the block.

''We've had opening dinners before,'' said the Shanghai artist Zhou Tiehai, sipping Chilean red wine, ''but nothing quite like this until very recently.''
The dinner, held on a recent Saturday night in a restaurant located on the top floor of a historic building that also houses an Armani store and the Shanghai Gallery of Art, was symbolic of the soaring fortunes of Chinese contemporary art.
In 2006 Sotheby's and Christie's, the world's biggest auction houses, sold $190 million worth of Asian contemporary art, most of it Chinese, in a series of record-breaking auctions in New York, London and Hong Kong. In 2004 the two houses combined sold $22 million in Asian contemporary art.
The climax came at a Beijing auction in November when a painting by Liu Xiaodong, 43, sold to a Chinese entrepreneur for $2.7 million, the highest price ever paid for a piece by a Chinese artist who began working after 1979, when loosened economic restrictions spurred a resurgence in contemporary art.
That price put Mr. Liu in the company of the few living artists, including Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons, whose work has sold for $2 million or more at auction.
''This has come out of nowhere,'' said Henry Howard-Sneyd, global head of Asian arts at Sotheby's, which, like Christie's, has just started a division focusing on contemporary Chinese art.
With auction prices soaring, hundreds of new studios, galleries and private art museums are opening in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai. Chinese auction houses that once specialized in traditional ink paintings are now putting contemporary experimental artworks on the block.
Western galleries, especially in Europe, are rushing to sign up unknown painters; artists a year out of college are selling photographic works for as much as $10,000 each; well-known painters have yearlong waiting lists; and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Pompidou Center in Paris are considering opening branches in China.
''What is happening in China is what happened in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century,'' said Michael Goedhuis, a collector and art dealer specializing in Asian contemporary art who has galleries in London and New York. ''New ground is being broken. There's a revolution under way.''
But the auction frenzy has also sparked debate here about whether sales are artificially inflating prices and encouraging speculators, rather than real collectors, to enter the art market.
Auction houses ''sell art like people sell cabbage,'' said Weng Ling, the director of the Shanghai Gallery of Art. ''They are not educating the public or helping artists develop. Many of them know nothing about art.''
But the boom in Chinese contemporary art -- reinforced by record sales in New York last year -- has also brought greater recognition to a group of experimental artists who grew up during China's brutal Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).
After the 1989 government crackdown in Tiananmen Square, avant-garde art was often banned from being shown here because it was deemed hostile or anti-authoritarian. Through the 1990s many artists struggled to earn a living, considering themselves lucky to sell a painting for $500.
That has all changed. These days China's leading avant-garde artists have morphed into multi-millionaires who show up at exhibitions wearing Gucci and Ferragamo.
Wang Guangyi, best-known for his Great Criticism series of Cultural Revolution-style paintings emblazoned with the names of popular Western brands, like Coke, Swatch and Gucci, drives a Jaguar and owns a 10,000-square-foot luxury villa on the outskirts of Beijing.
Yue Minjun, who makes legions of colorful smiling figures, has a walled-off suburban Beijing compound with an 8,000-square-foot home and studio. Fang Lijun, a ''Cynical Realist'' painter whose work captures artists' post-Tiananmen disillusionment, owns six restaurants in Beijing and operates a small hotel in western Yunnan province.
If China's art scene can be likened to a booming stock market, Zhang Xiaogang, 48, is its Google. More than any other Chinese artist Mr. Zhang, with his huge paintings depicting family photographs taken during the Cultural Revolution, has captured the imagination of international collectors. Prices for his work have skyrocketed at auction over the last two years.
When his work ''Bloodline Series: Comrade No. 120'' sold for $979,000 at Sotheby's auction in March, many art insiders predicted the market had topped out and prices would plummet within months.
But in October, the British collector Charles Saatchi bought another of Mr. Zhang's pieces at Christie's in London for $1.5 million. Then in November at Christie's Hong Kong auction, Mr. Zhang's 1993 ''Tiananmen Square'' sold to a private collector for $2.3 million. According to Artnet.com, which tracks auction prices, 16 of Mr. Zhang's works have sold for $500,000 or more during the past two years.
Are such prices justified? Uli Sigg, the former Swiss ambassador to China and perhaps the largest collector of Chinese contemporary art with more than 1,500 pieces, calls the market frothy but not finished.
''I don't see anything at the moment that will stop the rise in prices,'' he said. ''More and more people are flocking to the market.''
Mr. Goedhuis insists that this is the beginning of an even bigger boom in Chinese contemporary art.
''I don't think there's a bubble,'' he said. ''There's a lot of speculation but no bubble. That's the paradox. In China there are only a handful of buyers -- 10, 20, 30 -- out of a billion people. You only need another 10 to come in and that will jack up prices.''
He added: ''Another astonishing fact is there is not a single museum in the West that has committed itself to buying Chinese art. It's just starting to happen. Guggenheim, the Tate Modern, MoMA, they're all looking.''
Representatives from those museums, as well as others, have made scouting missions to China. A growing number of international collectors are looking at Chinese art too.
''After the 2005 Sotheby's show I just jumped in,'' said Didier Hirsch, a French-born California business executive who has long collected American and European contemporary art. ''People said the next big run-up in prices would be at Sotheby's in March so I said, 'Now or never.' '' Mr. Hirsch purchased nearly his entire collection -- about 40 works -- by phone after doing research on the Internet. He said he went first for what he called the titans -- the original group of post-'79 painters -- including Wang Guangyi and Liu Xiaodong.
Some critics here say the focus on prices has led to a decline in creativity as artists knock off variations of their best-known work rather than exploring new territory. Some are even employing teams of workers in assembly-line fashion.
Christopher Phillips, a curator at the International Center of Photography in New York, has become a regular visitor to China, scouting young artists for the center and other places. On a recent trip ''I went to visit the studio of a well-known Beijing painter,'' Mr. Phillips said. ''The artist wasn't there, but I saw a group of canvases being painted by a team of young women who seemed to be just in from the countryside. I found it a little disconcerting.''
There are also complaints that some artists are ignoring international standards by selling works directly into the auction market, rather than selling first to collectors. And many experts here say that some gallery officials and artists are sending representatives to the auctions to bid on their own works to prop up prices, or ''protect'' the prices of some rising stars.
But Lorenz Helbling, director of the ShanghART Gallery here, said Chinese artists continue to produce an impressive array of works, and that talk about the market being overrun by commercialism is exaggerated.
''Things are much better than they were 10 years ago,'' he said. ''Back then many artists were commissioned to simply paint dozens of paintings for a gallery owner, who went out and sold those works. Now these artists are thinking more deeply about their work because they're finally getting the recognition they deserve.''

There is more than one way to take the measure of books. You can of course read them. You can count pages, lines or words. Or you can dissect their texts, parsing and weighing words until they lose meaning while gaining literal substance, and then arrange the physical remnants of this concrete poetry into an epic of their own.
This is the method employed by Simryn Gill, who was born in Singapore and lives in Sydney, Australia, for her New York debut at the Tracy Williams gallery in the West Village. Ms. Gill, 47, has worked as a photographer, and this exhibition includes large black-and-white photographs of Run island, part of Indonesia; its small, dilapidated port was once central in the European nutmeg trade. The British ceded the island to the Dutch in 1667, as part of a treaty that gave the British a place called New Amsterdam, now known as Manhattan.
There are only a few days left to see the work of Simryn Gill at the Tracy Williams gallery, including the show’s centerpiece: a small, spare study room that contains a bubbling brew of broken words.

The British ceded the island to the Dutch in 1667, as part of a treaty that gave the British a place called New Amsterdam, now known as Manhattan.
Ms. Gill is also an installation artist adept at reconfiguring found objects, books included. This is clear in the show's centerpiece: a fascinating untitled work ensconced through Saturday in the front parlor of the Federal-era house occupied by Ms. Williams's gallery. The room is a small, spare study that quickly turns strange: a bubbling brew of broken thoughts, natural history, literature, knowledge and the courses of empires.
The piece, which had its debut last spring at Tate Modern in London, has aspects of standard-issue late Conceptual Art, yet it is absorbing and often moving. To make it, Ms. Gill selected 123 books and targeted about 80 words. With the help of assistants, she combed through the books page by page, methodically tearing out by hand all instances of these words.
The torn-out words were sorted and bagged, then divided among 30 small gray archival boxes, two to four bags to a box. The boxed, bagged words and the 123 raggedy books constitute the piece, exhibited with three tables and six stools.
You can sit at the two tables where the books are lined up, to study their spines and browse their ravaged pages. At the third, you can open the boxes and handle the bags. Either way, language takes on new dimensions, by turns obdurate and frail.
The books, published over the last 80 or so years, are arranged in a specific order, starting with ''Handy Pocket Guide to Asian Gemstones'' by Carol Clark and ending with a 1969 edition of ''Let Us Now Praise Famous Men'' by James Agee and Walker Evans. The fluctuation of titles and subjects forms a kind of literal graph or haphazard timeline.
Miles Hadfield's ''History of British Gardening'' is followed by Karl A. Wittfogel's ''Oriental Despotism,'' Buwei Yang Chao's ''How to Cook and Eat in Chinese'' and Sara Suleri's ''Meatless Days.'' Stephen Jay Gould's ''Wonderful Life'' stands beside ''Poisonous Snakes of the World,'' a manual for American amphibious forces published by the Navy in the 1960s as the American involvement in Vietnam was ramping up. The mental flights triggered by the titles are countered by the shared uselessness left between the covers. Hovering between literature and sculpture, these volumes are bereft, censored, fatally wounded.
At the third table the lost words are collated in a census of the censored. They resemble little flakes of bone, artifacts or specimens. One box holds two bags stuffed fat with the word ''still'' along with a thin, nearly empty one with a few forlorn scraps bearing the word ''sill.'' What a difference a letter makes.
Some boxes have plump bags of a single word: two each of ''found'' and ''water''; three each of ''first,'' ''now'' and ''because.'' In other bags alliteration plays tag with meaning: ''matter,'' ''heart,'' ''manner,'' ''roam.''
Always the different weights document a dwindling from frequently to rarely used. ''Enough,'' ''slow,'' ''veranda.'' ''Perhaps,'' ''rice,'' ''gingerly,'' ''lull.'' The words become weirdly humanized in this context, prompting thoughts about power, majorities and minorities, isolation and segregation and their crippling effects. Thus regimented, language is rendered useless. It becomes victim to tyranny.
Simryn Gill's work is on view through Saturday at Tracy Williams, 313 West Fourth Street, West Village, (212) 229-2757.

Christopher Wheeldon, one of the world's most sought-after choreographers, who recently announced an end to his residency at New York City Ballet, has formed his own company, a major event in the dance world.
The company, Morphoses the Wheeldon Company, is to make its debut in August at the Vail International Dance Festival in Colorado, followed by four to six performances at the Sadler's Wells Theater in London in September and roughly the same number at City Center in New York in October. The company is named after a 2002 dance that Mr. Wheeldon created for City Ballet.
Christopher Wheeldon is one of the world’s most sought-after choreographers and the formation of “Morphoses the Wheeldon Company” is a major event in the dance world.
Christopher Wheeldon, one of the world's most sought-after choreographers, who recently announced an end to his residency at New York City Ballet, has formed his own company, a major event in the dance world.
The company, Morphoses the Wheeldon Company, is to make its debut in August at the Vail International Dance Festival in Colorado, followed by four to six performances at the Sadler's Wells Theater in London in September and roughly the same number at City Center in New York in October. The company is named after a 2002 dance that Mr. Wheeldon created for City Ballet.
In an interview yesterday Mr. Wheeldon said performances would include a mix of his own choreography and works by others, performed by stars on loan from City Ballet and the Royal Ballet in London.
''We're still kind of at the hopes-and-dreams stage,'' he said, adding that he had approached no one to become a permanent member. ''I don't really believe in poaching,'' he said. ''I don't even know at this stage whether I can offer them the security they need.''
At Vail, he said, he planned to cast couples from the Hamburg Ballet, Pacific Northwest Ballet, San Francisco Ballet and City Ballet to dance the four pas de deux from his ''Polyphonia.''
Among the dancers tentatively scheduled to participate in his first season are Wendy Whelan, Sébastien Marcovici, Maria Kowroski, Sofiane Sylve and Edwaard Liang from City Ballet, and Darcey Bussell, Alina Cojocaru and Johan Kobborg from the Royal Ballet, where Mr. Wheeldon has danced and choreographed.
''None of these dancers reflect the dancers that are necessarily going to be in the company when it's formed in a more concrete way,'' he said.
Mr. Wheeldon said he would concentrate on the artistic side and focus on new works, including those by contemporary choreographers.
For now Lourdes Lopez, a former City Ballet principal, is handling administrative matters. The company is expected to have about 20 members and an annual budget of about $5 million.
Mr. Wheeldon declined to discuss specifics on how the company would be financed, saying only that some potential donors had shown interest. The initial performances are being presented by Vail, City Center and Sadler's Wells, which will cover the dancers' fees and serve as long-term partners of the company. He said he hoped those performances would attract interest from potential company members and donors.
The arrival of a new dance company is always an unusual event, given the funds needed to support an essentially money-losing endeavor. It is even rarer for an individual to establish a private company, as opposed to one sponsored by a city. But Mr. Wheeldon's stature and substantial body of work, especially at his tender age of 33, appear to be enough to attract backers.
Mr. Wheeldon said in November that he would leave City Ballet as its first resident choreographer when his contract expires in 2008. He is scheduled to choreograph two more works for it. Peter Martins, the City Ballet's ballet master in chief, said at the time that he was happy to see Mr. Wheeldon spread his wings.
Mr. Martins was in rehearsals and could not be immediately reached for comment yesterday.
Inevitably Mr. Wheeldon's company will compete for attention, donations and dancers, something Mr. Wheeldon indirectly acknowledged.
He said Mr. Martins gave his blessing, yet ''he understands also that this may mean some dancers will decide to come to me,'' Mr. Wheeldon said. ''That's just the way life is and the way things go.''
He continued, ''I'm sort of stepping into an area where people might think, 'Why does New York need another ballet company when we've already got two?' '' (In addition to City Ballet, New York is home to American Ballet Theater.) Answering his own question, he said, ''Maybe it doesn't, but I'm going to do it, and we'll see if I'm foolish or not.''
Mr. Wheeldon said he wanted to give dancers a greater voice, which is sometimes difficult in large companies like City Ballet. Referring to leaders of large companies in general, he said that casting decisions were not ''always handled in a perfectly sensitive way.''
''My mission is to create an environment that is collaborative in all respects,'' he said.
In an earlier recent interview he said he could make a ''change for the better in the ballet world'' by starting a company from scratch.
''I want to be in complete control of my personal artistic vision and goals,'' he said, ''and am not really interested in inheriting a legacy, but rather taking the opportunity to forge my own.'' Starting fresh also meant bypassing the ''big politics'' and bureaucracy of a large company, he said.
The idea began taking shape last summer when the San Francisco Ballet presented one of his pieces at the Lincoln Center Festival. The choreographer William Forsythe had a work on the same program, and the two spoke at length.
''He basically told me that I needed to take a step forward on my own and do something different, and coming from him -- he is a man who has continued to invent himself -- it was immediately resonant,'' Mr. Wheeldon said.
Mr. Wheeldon received a boost from an old friend at City Ballet, Damian Woetzel, who had recently become artistic director of the Vail festival and agreed to give him a springboard there.
''We're going to work together to further the ideas that we've been kicking around all these years,'' Mr. Woetzel said. ''It's a chance to make a real solid contribution.''
While mainly making dances for City Ballet -- itself long a vehicle for George Balanchine's work -- the British-born Mr. Wheeldon has been sought out by companies around the world, including the San Francisco Ballet, the Royal Ballet, the Bolshoi Ballet and the Philadelphia Ballet.
News of his plans have been percolating through the dance world but were not widely known.
''What a good idea,'' said George Steel, the executive director of the Miller Theater at Columbia University, which began expanding its dance offerings after an evening of Wheeldon choreography in the fall of 2005. ''More dancing is wonderful,'' Mr. Steel said. ''It's a huge opportunity for him to have a company he can run.''

''THE dismantling of the Deutsche Bank building will begin this fall and -- after careful, systematic deconstruction -- it will be gone next year.''
The speaker was Gov. George E. Pataki. The next year was 2005.
Officials now say the deconstruction of the contaminated Deutsche Bank building by the end of this year is critical to progress at the rest of the World Trade Center site.
''THE dismantling of the Deutsche Bank building will begin this fall and -- after careful, systematic deconstruction -- it will be gone next year.''
The speaker was Gov. George E. Pataki. The next year was 2005.
He's gone. The building isn't.
After a long while in which the demolition deadline at the badly contaminated former Deutsche Bank building at 130 Liberty Street seemed to be elastic, officials now say its deconstruction by the end of this year is critical to progress at the rest of the World Trade Center site.
''Any delay imperils the overall time schedule that we've established,'' Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff said yesterday.
That means that the 41-story tower will have to start coming down at the rate of almost one floor a week, leaving little margin for further delay.
''We have been given assurances that the building will be down by the end of this year,'' said Stephen Sigmund, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, ''assurances we are trusting since that is absolutely the latest we can accept in order to meet the Port Authority's aggressive and accountable timetable.''
Gov. Eliot Spitzer is ''confident that the demolition will proceed according to schedule,'' his press secretary, Christine Anderson, said. She added that the state ''will take every precaution while the search for human remains continues.''
To date, 766 remains have been recovered from the building. The first through fifth floors remain to be searched.
Charles J. Maikish, the executive director of the Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center, which has taken over the deconstruction project on what he called an ''interim basis'' from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, sounded optimistic.
''The planning, the engineering, the sequencing, the deconstruction method, the environmental controls have all been approved by the regulators and the work is going forward,'' he said last week. (In fact, one could look over Mr. Maikish's shoulder in his 29th-floor office at 1 Liberty Plaza and watch as workers removed aluminum sheathing from the columns at the top of the former bank tower.)
''A floor a week is achievable,'' Mr. Maikish said.
But there is at least one big imponderable. The state is negotiating with Bovis Lend Lease, the construction manager for the demolition project, and its subcontractor, the John Galt Corporation. The companies are seeking more money to cover expenses they had not anticipated when they submitted their bid, since the decontamination has proved far more complex and demanding than had been envisioned.
At issue is roughly $30 million in extra expenses and how much of that should be borne by the contractors.
For a few days beginning on Dec. 11, only 15 or 20 of Galt's workers, about 10 percent of the usual complement, were on the job. The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation called this a walkout and said negotiations would not resume until it ended. By Dec. 15, a full crew was back at work.
About the negotiations, Mary Costello, a senior vice president of Bovis, said yesterday, ''Bovis believes that the parties, exercising good faith, can resolve the issue.''
At first glance, it may be hard to see why the fate of the main trade center is so closely linked to an old bank tower one block south. But the sites are tightly linked -- underground -- through the Vehicular Security Center that the Port Authority plans to build on the south side of Liberty Street, an area now partly occupied by 130 Liberty Street. A series of ramps in this center will lead to the network of subterranean roadways tying the new trade center together.
Before the authority can build the center, it must first construct a reverse bathtub, contained by large slurry walls, to keep the groundwater out. And before it can construct the bathtub, the authority must move a large sewer line that is now under Liberty Street.
The relocated sewer line and part of the slurry wall run about 180 feet through the 130 Liberty Street parcel. To compress work time as much as possible, the authority plans to begin building the sewer line and the slurry wall before the tower is completely demolished, then finish the work once the tower has been razed.
In 2010, a year before the Vehicular Security Center is scheduled to be complete, its ramps are to be used for trucks serving the final phase of construction at Silverstein Properties' Tower 3 and Tower 4 on the main trade center site. That access is guaranteed by an agreement with Silverstein, which must, in turn, finish the towers by Dec. 31, 2011.
The timetable is tight. So no matter how confident officials sound in public, there are more than enough tenterhooks to go around.

In a rare reprise to a rare trial, the jury that convicted a Long Island man of murder by depraved indifference last October in a drunken-driving crash that killed a limousine driver and a 7-year-old girl may be brought back to court for hearings on whether some members acted improperly during deliberations.
In an answer submitted on Dec. 29 to a defense motion, Robert Hayden, an assistant Nassau County district attorney, agreed that a hearing should be held to determine if jurors discussed what they believed were prior drunken-driving charges against the defendant, Martin Heidgen, 25.
The jury could be brought back to court for hearings to determine if they discussed what they believed were prior drunken-driving charges against the defendant.
In a rare reprise to a rare trial, the jury that convicted a Long Island man of murder by depraved indifference last October in a drunken-driving crash that killed a limousine driver and a 7-year-old girl may be brought back to court for hearings on whether some members acted improperly during deliberations.
In an answer submitted on Dec. 29 to a defense motion, Robert Hayden, an assistant Nassau County district attorney, agreed that a hearing should be held to determine if jurors discussed what they believed were prior drunken-driving charges against the defendant, Martin Heidgen, 25.
Such accusations were not included in the evidence introduced in the five-week trial, and could be considered a contamination of the jury proceedings. Beyond that, Mr. Hayden said in his answer, that the belief of a previous drunken-driving arrest was ''not true,'' as far as he knew.
Mr. Hayden said the hearing should be limited to that issue, and rebuffed as ''irrelevant'' several other claims of impropriety raised by Mr. Heidgen's lawyer, Stephen LaMagna, as causes for setting aside the guilty verdict. Mr. LaMagna also claimed that some jurors felt pressured to vote to convict Mr. Heidgen of the most serious charge, that some discussed the case outside the jury room, and that one said she planned to write a book about it.
The Heidgen case was unusual because the defendant was prosecuted for a fatal drunken-driving crash under laws treating his crime as the functional equivalent of intentional murder. Such prosecutions, while not unprecedented, are considered rare and are usually brought only in the most horrific cases.
Mr. Heidgen, whose blood-alcohol level was three times the legal limit, was driving the wrong way on the Meadowbrook Parkway when his pickup truck crashed head-on with a limousine taking a family home from a wedding. The crash killed the limousine driver, Stanley Rabinowitz, 59, and Katie Flynn, who had been the flower girl.
The girl's parents and grandparents, who were also in the limousine, suffered minor injuries.
After three days of deliberations, the jury told Acting Justice Alan R. Honorof of State Supreme Court that it was deadlocked, but after he sent them back for more deliberations, reached a verdict on the fifth day.
Within days of the verdict, though, the jury forewoman said she had felt pressured to vote for the charge of ''murder by depraved indifference'' that Mr. Heidgen was convicted of, even though she believed he was guilty of the lesser crime of manslaughter. Based on the depraved indifference conviction, Mr. Heidgen faces a minimum of 25 years in prison. Manslaughter carries a minimum of 15 years.
Mr. Heidgen's lawyer, who could not be reached for comment on Wednesday, has said that based on interviews with other jury members, he believed that some jurors browbeat the last two holdouts who thought Mr. Heidgen was guilty of manslaughter, rather than murder.
''It is fairly rare for hearings like these to be held,'' said George Goltzer, vice president of the New York State Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. ''The general rule is that you don't let a jury impeach its own verdict. But if the charges are serious -- say that racism or serious misconduct was involved in the decision or something like that -- the courts have allowed it.''
Mr. Goltzer said he was not too familiar with the case, but added that evidence of ''extra-record information'' -- not part of the evidence introduced at the trial -- might qualify as serious enough to review a jury's verdict.
Justice Honorof is expected to decide in the next few days if and when hearings should be held. A spokesman for the district attorney, Kathleen Rice, said it was expected that with the district attorney's assent, the hearings would be scheduled.

186 <html><head><b><center>Citing 'Egregious' Conduct, Panel Removes Town Justice<center></b></head><p align="left">New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct removes Justice John T Greaney of Berlin Town Court for mistreating defendants, failing to appoint lawyers for them, and related misconduct; says Greaney tried to intimidate prosecutors to prevent them from complaining to commission (M)
The New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct announced yesterday that it had removed an upstate town justice for a number of improper acts, including efforts to intimidate prosecutors to keep them from complaining to the commission.
The commission said the justice, John T. Greaney of the Berlin Town Court in Rensselaer County, had mistreated defendants, failed to appoint lawyers for them, talked about his cases out of court, conducted his own investigations and worked in local politics even though judges are not permitted to do so.
The New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct said the justice, John T. Greaney of the Berlin Town Court in Rensselaer County had committed a number of improper acts, including the intimidation of prosecutors.
The New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct announced yesterday that it had removed an upstate town justice for a number of improper acts, including efforts to intimidate prosecutors to keep them from complaining to the commission.
The commission said the justice, John T. Greaney of the Berlin Town Court in Rensselaer County, had mistreated defendants, failed to appoint lawyers for them, talked about his cases out of court, conducted his own investigations and worked in local politics even though judges are not permitted to do so.
In 2004, the commission said, he told an assistant district attorney that he knew a lot of powerful people in state government and that if her office filed a complaint, he would not ''go down lightly.''
The commission's administrator, Robert H. Tembeckjian, said ''the numerous acts of egregious misconduct'' demonstrated the justice's unfitness for the bench.
Mr. Greaney declined to comment, and the commission said he did not respond to its complaint or attend a hearing scheduled in December. A lawyer who represented the justice, Brian E. Donohue, said he would not appeal. ''We came to the conclusion,'' Mr. Donohue said, ''that we really did not have a defense to at least some of the charges.''
Mr. Donohue said Mr. Greaney, 71, did not know that sitting judges are barred from political activities for other candidates when he circulated petitions to get candidates on the ballot in 2004. A part-time instructor at a community college, he was elected to the town court in 2003.
The commission said the petitions contained fraudulent entries, including a faked signature. Mr. Donohue declined to discuss the details.
The commission has moved frequently against town and village justices, who preside in small courts around the state. Last year, 6 of the more than 1,250 justices were either removed from office for serious misconduct or resigned while facing charges. The Legislature is examining possible changes in the court system after widespread criticism.
Like three-quarters of the justices, Mr. Greaney is not a lawyer. But he has deep political ties, and has long been active in Republican politics in Berlin, a town of 1,900 people east of Troy.
The decision announced yesterday included a catalog of injudicious behavior. It said Mr. Greaney had questioned a defendant without his lawyer present, called a defendant a liar based on information the justice had heard outside court, and told a police officer to threaten a defendant with jail time unless he became an informer.
When the justice addressed a group of students who knew a schoolmate facing charges in his court, the commission said, ''he told them they would not be seeing Corey for a long time'' because he was going to get the maximum sentence.
And when Justice Greaney came to believe that the county district attorney's office was preparing to file a complaint, the commission said, his response was explicit. He closed the door of his office and told the prosecutor he knew her office was trying to get him removed, the commission said.
He mentioned that he had been the Republican town chairman for 20 years. He said he would never talk to the prosecutor again. And he mentioned, the commission said, that he had ties to powerful people and sat on a state panel that gives grants to local prosecutors.

Gerald R. Ford was buried on Wednesday on a grassy hill beside the rushing waters of the Grand River as the sun set, a final farewell in a week of remembrances for the nation's 38th president.
Though Mr. Ford had lived elsewhere for decades, Grand Rapids made it clear that it still considered this his true home and that it still considered him one of its most beloved, famous -- and yet ordinary -- men.
In a city of 195,000 residents, some 57,000 waited to walk silently past Gerald R. Ford’s coffin before he was buried.
Gerald R. Ford was buried on Wednesday on a grassy hill beside the rushing waters of the Grand River as the sun set, a final farewell in a week of remembrances for the nation's 38th president.
Though Mr. Ford had lived elsewhere for decades, Grand Rapids made it clear that it still considered this his true home and that it still considered him one of its most beloved, famous -- and yet ordinary -- men.
In a city of 195,000 residents, some 57,000 waited since Tuesday evening in a line that wound through two miles of downtown to walk silently past Mr. Ford's coffin inside his presidential museum, steps from where he would be buried.
In temperatures that dipped into the low 30s, some people cheerfully waited six hours, deep into the night and morning, for a minute or two beside the former president, who died on Dec. 26 at age 93.
''We needed to be here -- this is how we feel about him here,'' Mary Castro said shortly before 3 a.m. Wednesday, still waiting to reach the museum after four hours in line. A family, carrying a 2-year-old in blankets beside her, nodded.
''He was an everyday, down-to-earth guy, so accessible, not one of these politicians nowadays who needs all sorts of bodyguards,'' said Ms. Castro, 62, of suburban Comstock Park. ''And he understood the importance of forgiveness.''
If the nation remembered Mr. Ford for his sudden arrival as president in 1974 in the midst of turmoil over the Watergate scandal and for his decision to pardon President Richard M. Nixon, Grand Rapids's memory was utterly different. Here, he was the boy who grew up on these streets, who played football for South High School, who became an Eagle Scout and who this region sent to the House of Representatives from 1949 until the 1970s.
He had taken the time to speak to elementary school government classes, to write birthday cards, to present crowns to homecoming queens. He was, some said, a perfect reflection of what people here are about.
''He was one of us,'' said Dwayne Hiljer, 69 and a retired salesman who drove three hours from his home near Detroit. ''I've been around for presidents since Roosevelt, and this is the only one that was always totally honest with you.''
Even after Mr. Ford's body was driven away from the museum -- the lines cut short when time ran out -- Grand Rapids followed him. Residents lined the streets, Boy Scouts in uniforms (and no coats) saluting, as his hearse and motorcade led the way to a final funeral service. The city gathered again along the bridges and the roofs of downtown buildings at dusk when the burial service began.
Mr. Ford was actually born in Omaha, but moved here as an infant with his mother. He had lived, at various times, in eight homes in the area.
During the funeral at Grace Episcopal Church, gleaming with stained glass, in East Grand Rapids, mourners remembered his modest roots and modest approach.
''There's an old saying in Washington that every member of the United States Congress looks in the mirror and sees a future president,'' Donald H. Rumsfeld, who served as defense secretary and chief of staff to Mr. Ford, said in a eulogy. ''Well, Jerry Ford was different. I suspect that when he looked in the mirror even after he became president, he saw a citizen and a public servant.''
The Fords had been longtime members of the church. Mr. Ford married his wife, Betty, at the parish's earlier building in 1948. Their first three children were baptized there. The funerals for Mr. Ford's mother and stepfather were held there.
The service on Wednesday, before 400 people, was more intimate, more personal than some earlier events.
Mr. Ford's grandchildren read prayers. Honorary pallbearers included a list of community leaders and friends from Grand Rapids, as well as Jack Nicklaus, the golfer; Mary Sue Coleman, the University of Michigan president; and Pepi Gramshammer, the skier. A University of Michigan blanket, yellow and blue, was left on a pew in honor of Bo Schembechler, the longtime Michigan football coach whom Mr. Ford had chosen to be an honorary pallbearer but who died late last year. Mr. Ford played for Michigan in the 1930s.
Richard Norton Smith, who used to be the director of the Ford museum and presidential library, described a man who knew how to laugh at himself and to get along despite divisiveness and partisanship.
''No one ever called Gerald Ford an imperial president,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Perhaps that was because no figure in memory was so immune to Washington's besetting disease of self-importance.''
Mr. Ford, a longtime member of Congress, succeeded Vice President Spiro T. Agnew and then Mr. Nixon after both men left office because of scandals.
Former President Jimmy Carter, who defeated Mr. Ford in 1976 but later became his close friend, said the precise words he used in his own inauguration -- 30 years ago -- remained the most appropriate tribute he could make to Mr. Ford, whose decision to pardon Mr. Nixon had drawn angry critics as well as supporters, who said he had helped spare the country more turmoil.
''For myself and for our nation, I want to thank my predecessor,'' Mr. Carter said on Wednesday, pausing to gather his emotions, ''for all he did to heal our land.''
As dusk fell on a cold, clear afternoon, Mr. Ford's family, emotional and holding on to one another, gathered for the burial outside the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum, near the grass beside the Grand River. The Army chorus somberly sang ''Goin' Home.'' The Rev. Dr. Robert G. Certain said a prayer. Canons sent a cloud of thick smoke and loud echoes across a silent downtown. F-15s zipped loudly past in formation, traveling north along the river's edge.
Vice President Dick Cheney handed the flag -- the carefully folded flag from Mr. Ford's coffin -- to Mrs. Ford, who nodded and clutched it briefly to her face.

Whatever it was, the object that fell from the sky was not part of an airplane. That was all anyone knew for sure.
It was dense with a rough metallic surface. The oblong object was only about two inches long -- fitting into the palm of a hand -- but weighed almost a pound. And it fell through the roof of a two-story house here Tuesday afternoon, shattering the tile floor of the second-floor bathroom and embedding itself in a wall.
An oblong object about two inches long but weighing almost a pound crashed through the roof of a two-story house in Freehold Township, N.J.
Whatever it was, the object that fell from the sky was not part of an airplane. That was all anyone knew for sure.
It was dense with a rough metallic surface. The oblong object was only about two inches long -- fitting into the palm of a hand -- but weighed almost a pound. And it fell through the roof of a two-story house here Tuesday afternoon, shattering the tile floor of the second-floor bathroom and embedding itself in a wall.
''No one was injured,'' said Lt. Robert Brightman of the Freehold Township Police Department at a press conference Wednesday while discussing the possibly extraterrestrial event. His investigators had put the object, whatever it was, in a plastic cylinder, where it sat on a bed of aqua blue Styrofoam inside the cylinder.
Flanked by a detective and a representative from the local emergency management office, Lieutenant Brightman said that after the object entered the home in a housing development here (passing through shingles and sheathing and insulation), a test with a Geiger counter indicated that at least it was not radioactive.
''Would you call that kidney-shaped?'' a reporter asked. The officer said he did not know.
Specialists in the field were testing the small, dense object, the lieutenant said, although he declined to say who the specialists were. All he would say was that the specialists were expert in ''investigating unusual objects of this type.'' Then the lieutenant threw out a tantalizing word: ''Quadrantids'' -- meteor showers that peak in January when northern skies are cold and cloudy.
''Actually, you can see them around Jan. 1 to the 6th,'' said Gareth Williams, an astronomer at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, based in Cambridge, Mass. ''In a good year, there are 100 meteors an hour.''
It seemed like a solid clue, at least until Mr. Williams added, ''I am unaware of any case where a meteorite is proven to have fallen as a result of a meteor shower.''
Many meteorites fall to earth every day, Mr. Williams said, most of them into the sea or the vast unpopulated parts of the earth. Once or twice a year, they hit a house or a car, he added.
Lieutenant Brightman did not identify the family whose house was struck by the object, except to say that it was in the Colt's Pride development.
He said that a woman who lives there with her husband and son said that they heard a noise on Tuesday afternoon, and that her son found the object in the bathroom later that night. But they waited until Wednesday morning to notify the police.
Until the tests are completed, perhaps in a few days, the officer said, the object would remain in the custody of an officer.

A $9.6 million city contract to renovate and operate a golf course in Marine Park in Brooklyn was headed for further review yesterday after the city comptroller raised concerns about ties between the contractor and a man accused of being a soldier in the Colombo crime family.
In a letter sent Tuesday, City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. urged the Parks and Recreation Department to reconsider the 20-year concession contract with East Coast Golf. Mr. Thompson cited references in federal court papers to the company's president, Dominick Logozzo, and his financial relationship with Craig Marino, whom federal prosecutors describe as ''a soldier in the Colombo family.''
City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. urged the Parks and Recreation Department to reconsider the 20-year concession contract with East Coast Golf.
A $9.6 million city contract to renovate and operate a golf course in Marine Park in Brooklyn was headed for further review yesterday after the city comptroller raised concerns about ties between the contractor and a man accused of being a soldier in the Colombo crime family.
In a letter sent Tuesday, City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. urged the Parks and Recreation Department to reconsider the 20-year concession contract with East Coast Golf. Mr. Thompson cited references in federal court papers to the company's president, Dominick Logozzo, and his financial relationship with Craig Marino, whom federal prosecutors describe as ''a soldier in the Colombo family.''
Mr. Marino was one of 10 reputed mob members indicted in March on federal racketeering and conspiracy charges in connection with a stock fraud scheme that allegedly bilked investors of more than $20 million. Prosecutors contend that he has a long, violent history, including beatings and stabbings, according to court documents.
Mr. Logozzo, who has not been implicated in any criminal activity cited in the indictment, was awarded a 20-year contract on Jan. 1, 2006, to operate the city-owned Marine Park Golf Course. The 18-hole course is one of a dozen city courses, all operated by private vendors, said Warner Johnston, a department spokesman.
Mr. Johnston said the contract was awarded before the indictments were filed and complied with all ''the relevant legal requirements.'' But because of the concerns expressed by the comptroller, the department has asked the city's Law Department and the Department of Investigation to review the contract.
Mr. Logozzo did not return phone calls left at his place of business yesterday.
In pretrial detention documents filed in March, Mr. Marino's lawyer, Joseph R. Corozzo, wrote that his client and Mr. Logozzo were childhood friends, and that Mr. Logozzo had lent Mr. Marino's father $48,000 to invest in a food service company known as the Zone Diet.
That investment, Mr. Corozzo wrote, has been the son's sole source of recent income. Mr. Corozzo did not return phones calls left at his office yesterday. In court documents, the lawyer said Mr. Logozzo has an ''unimpeachable background.''
In addition to the loan, documents filed by the United States attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York State said that Mr. Logozzo is the registered owner of a Lincoln Navigator that Mr. Marino drives.
Mr. Thompson said those financial relationships gave ''rise to numerous integrity concerns about the concessionaire.''
According to Parks Department documents, Mr. Logozzo's contract calls for it to pay the city a minimum of $9.6 million in fees over 20 years. It also offered to pay additional fees for a restaurant and banquet center.
The company beat out four other bidders to win the contract, including one proposal that offered a minimum $10.35 million in fees. Mr. Johnston said the fee offer was just one of several factors used to assess the proposals.
Mr. Johnston said East Coast Golf's contract called for the company to invest $4.4 million in capital improvements in the course over 20 years. The company has already invested about $1 million, he said.
Though the contract was awarded on Jan. 1, 2006, the Parks Department did not submit the agreement to the comptroller, who must register the contract, until November.
The concerns about the golf course contract come as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is seeking to restrict powers of the comptroller and borough presidents to approve city deals with vendors. The change is part of a series of measures that would include eliminating background checks of vendors in some circumstances until they have been awarded their contracts.
Administration officials say the proposed changes are part of an overall movement to streamline the way contracts are awarded and bring more transparency to a process that has been subject to corruption and inefficiency.
Mr. Thompson, who is critical of the change, has said it would give him and the borough presidents much less opportunity to catch things like potential mob ties, bankruptcies and other financial problems with would-be vendors.

Tennessee has collected nearly $3.5 million since it began enforcing its tax on illegal drugs two years ago, officials from the Department of Revenue said Wednesday.
The state's Unauthorized Substances Tax, passed by the Legislature in 2004, requires anyone in possession of an illegal drug to buy and affix stamps to the drugs' packaging.
Tennessee has collected nearly $3.5 million since it began enforcing its tax on illegal drugs two years ago, officials from the Department of Revenue said.
Tennessee has collected nearly $3.5 million since it began enforcing its tax on illegal drugs two years ago, officials from the Department of Revenue said Wednesday.
The state's Unauthorized Substances Tax, passed by the Legislature in 2004, requires anyone in possession of an illegal drug to buy and affix stamps to the drugs' packaging.
Under the law, information provided to the Department of Revenue to buy stamps cannot be used in criminal prosecutions. There is a toll-free number for stamp application requests, and stamps are doled out based on type of drug and weight.
As is the case in some two dozen other states with similar laws, however, the stamps have become curiosities bought by collectors and lobbyists who campaigned for the bill.
Of the 726 stamps sold so far, none have turned up on seized drugs, said Loren Chumley, commissioner of revenue for the State of Tennessee.
While many think that the idea is inspired, others object to it.
''It's almost like the law wasn't written to be construed seriously,'' said Gregory P. Isaacs, a lawyer in Knoxville. ''It's like asking for someone to get a special permit before they drive drunk.''
The real money the law generates comes from penalties assessed on people caught with unstamped drugs. Fines may equal up to 10 times the amount of the tax, and are vigorously collected, Mr. Isaacs said.
Because the taxes can be collected based on a preponderance of evidence, rather than a determination of guilt, defense lawyers are challenging the law, saying it violates the guarantee against double jeopardy and the right to due process.
In one case in July, an appellate court ruled that the law was unconstitutional. That decision is being appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court.

President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad warned Wednesday that Iran would not back down from its nuclear ambitions and said his country would soon start producing nuclear fuel on an industrial scale.
''Iran has the fuel cycle, and very soon we will push the button on nuclear fuel production for industrial uses,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad said in a speech in the southern city of Ghotvand in Khuzestan Province, according to the ISNA news agency.
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Wednesday that his country would soon start producing nuclear fuel on an industrial scale.
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad warned Wednesday that Iran would not back down from its nuclear ambitions and said his country would soon start producing nuclear fuel on an industrial scale.
''Iran has the fuel cycle, and very soon we will push the button on nuclear fuel production for industrial uses,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad said in a speech in the southern city of Ghotvand in Khuzestan Province, according to the ISNA news agency.
The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution late last month banning the trade of goods and technology that could benefit Iran's uranium enrichment, reprocessing and ballistic missile systems. Enriched uranium can be used for making nuclear weapons or as fuel for nuclear energy plants.
The resolution gave Iran a two-month deadline to suspend its enrichment program, but Iran says that it has the right to enrich uranium as a member of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
''The Iranian people will not retreat one iota from their rights,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad vowed Wednesday, adding that Iran would celebrate its nuclear achievements in February, on the 28th anniversary of the victory of the Iranian revolution of 1979.
''The Iranian people have made their decision to continue this path wisely and will not pay attention to empty cries of the materialists and the bullying of the decadent powers,'' he said.
Other senior officials have also warned that Iran will not surrender in the face of pressure.
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, an influential cleric and the head of the Expediency Council, warned last week that pressing Iran could have consequences.
''This is a very dangerous resolution,'' he said during Friday Prayer at Tehran University. ''They are creating problems for themselves and the region,'' he said, adding that ''many will suffer from the smoke of this fire.''
One former nuclear negotiator for Iran, Hossein Moussavian, warned the nation's current negotiators on Wednesday that ignoring the resolution and calling it illegal would not help. He said the resolution could have severe consequences for Iran, ISNA reported. ''We can say inside the country that this resolution is illegal, but we have to have a correct understanding of the international community's considerations,'' he was quoted as saying.

Kenyan officials announced Wednesday that they were closing their northern border because of the conflict in Somalia, but denied that they had turned back hundreds of refugees.
For the past few days, Ethiopian-led forces have been hunting down the remnants of Somalia's once powerful Islamist movement, pushing fighters steadily south toward the Kenyan border. Ethiopian officials have said the Islamist fighters are headed to a remote jungle outpost called Ras Kamboni, which terrorism suspects have used before as a hide-out.
With the final throes of the conflict in Somalia on their doorstep, Kenyan officials said they had no choice but to close the border.
Kenyan officials announced Wednesday that they were closing their northern border because of the conflict in Somalia, but denied that they had turned back hundreds of refugees.
For the past few days, Ethiopian-led forces have been hunting down the remnants of Somalia's once powerful Islamist movement, pushing fighters steadily south toward the Kenyan border. Ethiopian officials have said the Islamist fighters are headed to a remote jungle outpost called Ras Kamboni, which terrorism suspects have used before as a hide-out.
It now seems that Somalia's problems have sucked in yet another country, and with the final throes of the conflict on their doorstep, Kenyan officials said they had no choice but to act.
''We needed to close the border so we could closely vet all refugees,'' said Alfred N. Mutua, a spokesman for the Kenyan government.
But Mr. Mutua denied news reports and accusations from United Nations officials that Kenyan border guards had deported 600 Somalis seeking asylum, saying that the closing applied only to cross-border trade and nonrefugee traffic, to prevent the Islamists from slipping into the country.
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres told Agence France-Presse on Wednesday that Kenya ''has a humanitarian obligation to allow civilians at risk to seek asylum on its territory.''
Mr. Mutua said that 10 foreign Islamist fighters were caught Monday trying to cross the border in a throng of refugees. The fighters were carrying briefcases packed with cash. Kenyan officials said they probably had been financiers of Somalia's Islamist movement, which was routed last week by Ethiopian soldiers supporting Somalia's transitional government.
As hundreds of Somalis continue to line up at the border each day, hoping for asylum, Kenya has buttressed its patrols with extra troops and helicopters. Residents on the Kenyan side of the border have reported skirmishes in Kenya, but Mr. Mutua said that was not the case.
''We're just trying to make sure none of the problems from Somalia spill across the border, and so far none has,'' he said.
In Mogadishu, Somalia's battle-scarred capital, several weapons were collected Wednesday in the transitional government's drive to disarm one of the most heavily armed citizenries in the world. On Monday, Ali Mohammed Gedi, the transitional prime minister, issued one of his first edicts, demanding that Somali warlords and gunmen turn in their military-grade weapons by Thursday. If they did not, he said, homes would be searched.
Elders from one of Mogadishu's more powerful subclans turned over a pickup truck equipped with an antiaircraft gun and 20 young fighters. Transitional government officials said the weapons and men would be folded into Somalia's new national army.
Meanwhile, Islamist leaders continued to insist that they had not been defeated.
''I cannot say where we are, but we are in Somalia and we are not afraid anymore,'' Abdulrahim Ali Modei, the Islamists' spokesman, said Wednesday in a telephone call to a Somali radio station.

President Hugo Chávez has begun forging a single Socialist party among his varied supporters, one of his recent efforts to create momentum for far-reaching changes to Venezuela's political system that analysts say will effectively concentrate greater political power in his hands.
Mr. Chávez formally announced the plan for the single party, called the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, in a speech last month to supporters here. He reminded them of his 23-percentage-point margin of victory when he was re-elected last month to a six-year term.
The swiftness of President Hugo Chávez’s attempt to create a large party tied so closely to his personal leadership has created concern.
President Hugo Chávez has begun forging a single Socialist party among his varied supporters, one of his recent efforts to create momentum for far-reaching changes to Venezuela's political system that analysts say will effectively concentrate greater political power in his hands.
Mr. Chávez formally announced the plan for the single party, called the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, in a speech last month to supporters here. He reminded them of his 23-percentage-point margin of victory when he was re-elected last month to a six-year term.
''Those votes don't belong to any party.'' Mr. Chávez said. ''They belong to Chávez and the people.''
Since then the swiftness and boldness of Mr. Chávez's attempt to create such a large party tied so closely to his personal leadership have created concern, even among sympathetic political analysts, that the step would effectively turn Venezuela into a one-party state.
In an essay published on Aporrea, an influential pro-Chávez blog, Edgardo Lander, a sociologist at the Central University of Venezuela, questioned the reasoning behind forming a single political party described as Socialist when the definition of the ''21st-century Socialism'' that Mr. Chávez aspires to build remained extremely vague.
''Isn't the cart being placed in front of the ox?'' Mr. Lander wrote. ''What future, from the point of view of pluralism and democracy, lies ahead for a political organization decreed in this fashion?''
Analysts more critical of Mr. Chávez have drawn a parallel with Fidel Castro's successful effort to create a single ruling party in Cuba in the early 1960s.
Mr. Chávez has tried to assuage concerns that his project would lead to authoritarianism by saying party leaders would largely be chosen by his rank-and-file supporters, an idea lambasted by critics here. ''His tireless finger won't stop singling out those who are going to be the bosses,'' said Teodoro Petkoff, the editor of the opposition-aligned newspaper Tal Cual.
Some of Mr. Chávez's supporters say the creation of a single party would strengthen the government's hand in combating excessive bureaucracy and corruption stemming from the need to distribute political spoils to an array of different parties. Others view the new party as a way to remain ahead of a fractious opposition.
The move has already revealed tensions within the coalition of more than 20 political parties that currently supports the president. Critics of the plan say it could marginalize relatively small pro-Chávez parties that support an open economy, existing government institutions and a pluralistic political system.
By contrast, much of the support comes from more hard-line members of Mr. Chávez's own party, the Fifth Republic Movement, which was dissolved last month to make way for its larger successor.
Some of those supporters want to strengthen parallel political institutions created by Mr. Chávez, like a system of health clinics and universities closely tied to the president and his Socialist project for the nation.
For instance, he has announced a plan to build as many as 50 new universities, expected to be modeled on the three-year-old Bolivarian University of Venezuela, which provides Socialist-inspired, tuition-free classes to more than 170,000 students.
''We're witnessing a struggle between two ideological currents within the Chavista movement,'' said Steve Ellner, a political scientist at University of the East in Venezuela.
Some of the strongest resistance comes from Mr. Chávez's allies on the far left. The Communist Party, in particular, stands to lose considerable stature if it folds into the new party, though it is expected to do so.
The Communists have weathered decades of persecution and the collapse of the Soviet Union. ''The Communist Party was created to defend the workers and should continue this struggle,'' Jerónimo Carrera, a senior party official, told the newspaper El Nacional.
Mr. Chávez's critics on the left and right regularly say he is carrying out a ''fake revolution'' exemplified by a boom in consumer spending on imported goods and the distribution of economic favors and government contracts to those who support his oil-financed administration.
But Mr. Chávez has also created thousands of agricultural and industrial cooperatives. And he has expanded the influence of ''communal councils,'' groups of 20 or so people in poor areas who make routine planning decisions and are financed by small communal banks. He said recently that he would put $2 billion at the disposal of these councils in 2007.
He still runs the risk, however remote, of losing one or two smaller but important parties in his coalition. These parties, which include Podemos and Fatherland for All, are expected to decide this month whether to join the new party.
As Mr. Chávez presses forward with that party, he seems eager to imbue senior officials with a greater understanding of Socialist ideology, as well as closer allegiance to his own wishes.
Late last year, legislators in the National Assembly, controlled by supporters of Mr. Chávez, were enrolled in classes on Marxist analysis and socialist thinking taught by professors from the National Armed Forces Experimental University.
Signaling a desire for even his highest-ranking allies to fall into step with what he calls his Bolivarian Revolution, Mr. Chávez publicly dressed down Vice President José Vicente Rangel and Interior Minister Jesse Chacón last month.
The reason? They let an orchestra omit the Panamanian anthem from an act honoring Simón Bolívar, the South American independence leader, who died 176 years ago.
''We have to struggle against such inefficiency,'' Mr. Chávez said in comments broadcast on the state television. ''What a shame to have such disorganization for such a sublime event,'' he added, as a small crowd in attendance applauded.

Mischief in presidential politics in Florida?
Perhaps so, some circumstantial evidence suggests.
Advisers to Rudolph W. Giuliani say that someone stole an aide’s luggage during a political trip in Florida and that its contents were leaked to The Daily News.
Mischief in presidential politics in Florida?
Perhaps so, some circumstantial evidence suggests.
The mystery thus far: Advisers to Rudolph W. Giuliani say that someone stole an aide's luggage during a political trip last fall, found a 140-page strategy notebook inside and photocopied it, then returned the luggage in some manner and gave the goods to a Giuliani opponent.
The contents of the notebook ended up splashed across The Daily News in New York on Tuesday. Not to be outdone, The New York Post reported yesterday that political operatives believed that the theft happened on a campaign trip through Florida.
While it does not prove anything per se, a spokeswoman for the governor of Florida, Charlie Crist, a Republican, confirmed yesterday that luggage from the Giuliani entourage was indeed missing during a campaign trip last fall.
''They were traveling with us, and we did find a piece of luggage, and we just worked as quickly as possible to get it back to the owner,'' said Erin Isaac, the spokeswoman.
Ms. Isaac said she had no information about allegations by Mr. Giuliani's office that someone, somewhere, stole and photocopied the notebook; she added that the governor's office was not conducting an inquiry into those allegations.
She said that the piece of luggage was left on a Crist plane ''during the chaos of the campaign,'' and that nothing fishy happened with the bag when it was in their custody.
''No copies were made. The bag was found and held until we were able to return it to the owner,'' Ms. Isaac said.
She said that Mr. Crist's campaign switched planes all the time last fall, and that she did not have specifics about the plane, luggage or trip involving the Giuliani contingent.
Sunny Mindel, a spokeswoman for Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, issued a statement yesterday that underscored one certainty in this mystery: Mr. Giuliani, as a possible Republican candidate for president, cannot afford to alienate the Republican who is set to lead Florida through the 2008 balloting.
''We have no question that whatever happened had nothing to do with Governor Crist or his staff,'' said the statement from Anthony Carbonetti, a senior political adviser to Mr. Giuliani. ''The mayor has the highest regard for Governor Crist.''

The sleek, bulbous-nosed new bullet trains here look like they are designed to whisk passengers across wide-open spaces. But on this congested island, they represent the start of a 180-mile-per-hour commuter train system.
After a quarter century of planning and construction, the system is scheduled to open on Jan. 5. It will tie together cities and towns where 94 percent of Taiwan's population lives, offering an alternative to clogged highways and the air pollution the vehicles on them produce.
The cost of Taiwan’s new commuter train system  $15 billion, or $650 for every person on Taiwan  has made it a subject of dispute.
The sleek, bulbous-nosed new bullet trains here look like they are designed to whisk passengers across wide-open spaces. But on this congested island, they represent the start of a 180-mile-per-hour commuter train system.
After a quarter century of planning and construction, the system is scheduled to open on Jan. 5. It will tie together cities and towns where 94 percent of Taiwan's population lives, offering an alternative to clogged highways and the air pollution the vehicles on them produce.
For some urban planners and environmentalists, the project is an example of how Asia may be able to control oil imports, curb fast-rising emissions of global-warming gases and bring a higher standard of living to enormous numbers of people in an environmentally sustainable way.
Passengers who travel on a fully loaded train will use only a sixth of the energy they would use if they drove alone in a car and will release only one-ninth as much carbon dioxide, the main gas linked to global warming. Compared with a bus ride, the figures are half the energy and a quarter of the carbon dioxide, train system officials said.
But the system's enormous cost -- $15 billion, or $650 for every man, woman and child on Taiwan -- has made it a subject of dispute. And a series of commercial disputes since the project began in 1980 has produced a remarkable hodgepodge: French and German train drivers who are allowed to speak only English with Taiwanese traffic controllers while operating Japanese bullet trains on tracks originally designed by British and French engineers.
The system has become so complex that the leader of Taiwan's consumer movement is calling for citizens to boycott it entirely until extensive safety data is released.
''Cherish your life, don't be a guinea pig,'' Cheng Jen-hung, the chairman of the Consumers' Foundation, said in an interview, repeating his group's slogan. With 900 passengers on a fully loaded train, he warned, ''if there is an accident, there will be very heavy casualties.''
Arthur Chiang, the vice president for administration at Taiwan High Speed Rail, said the system was completely safe. But he acknowledged that the project had been bedeviled by opposition.
''Pandora's box has already opened and everything has come out except hope and mutual trust,'' he said during a recent test run on one of the new trains from the capital, Taipei, in the north, to the city of Taichung, in west-central Taiwan. ''We just wanted to make it simple, but we failed,'' he added. ''Politics is one of the factors.''
Using overhead electric lines instead of diesel locomotives, the trains will run from Taipei down through western Taiwan to Kaohsiung, the main industrial city in the south. That is a distance of 215 miles, about the same as between New York and Washington.
The system will start with 19 trains in each direction daily and eventually will be able to handle 88 trains daily in each direction.
Planning started in 1980, when Taiwan was still under martial law. The route was preliminarily picked in 1991, as Taiwan was starting on the path to become the vibrant, even tempestuous, democracy that it is today. Every large city and town along the route lobbied to have its own stop and new railway station, and a succession of governments agreed.
Three trains a day will travel from Taipei to Kaohsiung in 90 minutes, with just one stop, in Taichung. But most of the trains will make six intermediate stops, lengthening travel time to two hours and seven minutes.
That is still 38 minutes faster than Amtrak's Acela Express between New York and Washington, which also has up to six intermediate stops but a lower top speed. But flights between Taipei and Kaohsiung take just 40 minutes.
Enormous stations resembling state-of-the-art airport terminals have been built on the outskirts of each city along the route except Taipei, where the existing main rail station is being used. The new stations cannot be in most downtown areas because of the difficulty in acquiring land for tracks: the high-speed trains travel almost entirely on specially built, 60-foot-tall viaducts to avoid the need to cross roads.
Smaller trains and buses will link the new stations to downtown.
Although many urban planners see systems like this one as positive for the environment, Lee Schipper, the research director at Embarq, an environmental transport research group in Washington, said the system could eventually increase the use of energy, rather than save it, if the ease of using the trains encouraged people to move farther away from work.
The expectation in Taiwan is that the train system will attract a lot of users at first, notwithstanding Mr. Cheng's call for a boycott; the consumer movement here is not as big or visible as it was even 10 years ago.
A French train driver sporting a magnificent handlebar mustache, who declined to give his name, sent Mr. Chiang's train hurtling down the tracks on the recent test run. The driver said the trains were actually simpler to operate than those in France. ''It's easier, it's all automatic,'' he said in French. But the requirement that all communications take place in English is a complication, he added. The electronic displays in the cabs of each train are also in English.
The Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation is training Taiwanese drivers to replace the European drivers and plans to switch the entire system to spoken Chinese and Chinese-language computer displays in about three years, Mr. Chiang said. The consortium had expected to hire experienced Japanese drivers, but the Japanese companies that made the trains were unable to persuade Japan's rail system operators to transfer any of their drivers to Taiwan.
Whether the train system becomes a commercial success will partly depend on how many people use its somewhat inconveniently located stations, how quickly the land is developed around these stations and how much the tickets cost. The initial price for a one-way, coach ticket from Taipei to Kaohsiung will be $44, or two-thirds the price of a typical airline ticket.
Riding the train is much like a very low-altitude flight, and very quiet. Chen Chi-cheng, a 5-year-old invited on the test run, watched with fascination as the rooftops of houses flashed past. ''It's like a plane,'' he said breathlessly.

A special election will be held on Feb. 20 to fill two City Council seats left vacant in Brooklyn and on Staten Island, the city's Board of Elections said yesterday.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg set the date after the resignations of Yvette D. Clarke, a Brooklyn Democrat, and Andrew J. Lanza, a Staten Island Republican.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg set the date after the resignations of Yvette D. Clarke, a Brooklyn Democrat, and Andrew J. Lanza, a Staten Island Republican.
A special election will be held on Feb. 20 to fill two City Council seats left vacant in Brooklyn and on Staten Island, the city's Board of Elections said yesterday.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg set the date after the resignations of Yvette D. Clarke, a Brooklyn Democrat, and Andrew J. Lanza, a Staten Island Republican.
The date gives candidates two weeks to file petitions proclaiming their intentions with the Board of Elections. The filing deadline is midnight Jan. 16, said John Ravitz, the board's executive director.
Winning candidates will serve for the rest of the year and will automatically be put on the September primary ballot or the November general election ballot if a primary is not held, Mr. Ravitz said.
Ms. Clarke resigned her District 40 seat after winning the Congressional seat for central Brooklyn in November. Mr. Lanza left his District 51 seat for the State Senate.
The City Council held its 2007 inaugural meeting yesterday and passed one piece of legislation, which requires the city to look at 300 of its highest-energy-using buildings to see if clean-burning natural gas generators can be installed to ease electricity use, especially in the summer. The mayor is expected to sign the bill.
The special election comes as the Bloomberg administration and the Board of Elections gird for problems in this year's elections. The state's Board of Elections has yet to certify voting machines that meet federal requirements to overhaul the system and replace aging machines.
The state has been under increasing pressure since the Justice Department sued it last year for failing to comply with guidelines enacted by Congress in 2002. Those guidelines were intended to spur states to modernize their systems to avoid an election debacle like the one in Florida in 2000.
The state is not expected to make its selections until February, and election officials say that will not give them enough time to install software, train staff members and poll workers and advise the public on how to operate the new machines. The state risks losing $20 million in federal money if a new system is not in place by the fall election.
The special election will be held using the old lever-operated machines, Mr. Ravitz said. Important dates and deadlines and other instructions for the special election can be found on the Board of Elections Web site at vote.nyc.ny.us/index.html.

The federal investigation into the business activities of Joseph L. Bruno, who was re-elected majority leader of the State Senate on Wednesday, has widened to include an Albany investment firm that has had close ties to him, public records show.
The Daily News reported on Wednesday that federal authorities had issued a subpoena to obtain documents from McGinn, Smith & Company, an investment firm that was a client of the senator's private consulting business.
The Daily News reported that federal authorities had issued a subpoena to obtain documents from a client of Joseph L. Bruno’s private consulting business.
The federal investigation into the business activities of Joseph L. Bruno, who was re-elected majority leader of the State Senate on Wednesday, has widened to include an Albany investment firm that has had close ties to him, public records show.
The Daily News reported on Wednesday that federal authorities had issued a subpoena to obtain documents from McGinn, Smith & Company, an investment firm that was a client of the senator's private consulting business.
The company's chairman, Timothy M. McGinn, who founded the firm with David L. Smith in 1980, would not discuss the subpoena. ''We're cooperating fully with the investigation,'' Mr. McGinn said in a brief telephone interview.
The financial interests of Mr. Bruno and Mr. McGinn have intersected several times over the years, according to public records.
In 1999, Mr. Bruno reported making a profit from the sale of stock he owned in the Pointe Financial Corporation, a bank holding company in Boca Raton, Fla., where Mr. McGinn was vice chairman and an investor. That profit was reported on a disclosure form filed with the Legislative Ethics Committee, but the publicly available section does not indicate when he bought the stock or how much he made on the sale.
According to records from the State Board of Elections, two campaign committees controlled by Mr. Bruno invested contributions in recent years in two companies run by Mr. McGinn: Integrated Alarm Services Group and the Capital Center Credit Corporation.
Although campaigns typically leave excess cash in bank accounts, it is legal for them to invest it in stocks, bonds and other financial instruments. Campaign finance regulations do not require that committees disclose where they make such investments, but they must report any income gained from them.
Records show that from November 2001 to March 2003, Capital Center Credit -- an affiliate of McGinn, Smith -- paid $121,470 in ''interest or dividends'' to Mr. Bruno's committee and the Senate Republican Campaign Committee, and that from May 2003 to September 2004, Integrated Alarm paid $145,833 to the two committees.
Integrated Alarm, which monitors security alarms, went public in 2003. In 2004, Mr. McGinn sold much of his stake in McGinn, Smith to focus on his role as chairman and chief executive at the alarm company. He was ousted from the company in June, partly because he resisted talk of a merger. Last month, the company announced that it was being bought by another company for $84.8 million.
There are other ties between Mr. Bruno and McGinn, Smith. In 1997, The Village Voice reported that Mr. Bruno was a part-time consultant to the firm in 1993 and 1994.
In 2003, Mr. Bruno announced that he had secured $500,000 in state aid for a proposed $470 million educational, tourism and entertainment project on the Troy, N.Y., riverfront. Pieter S. VanDerzee, an executive at McGinn, Smith at the time, was one of the three main investors in that venture.
John E. McArdle, a spokesman for the senator, said that Mr. Bruno's support for the project was ''absolutely and unequivocally not'' connected to any involvement by McGinn, Smith. ''Senator Bruno never provided any funds for the Harbor at Troy waterfront project because the developers who proposed it did not have the backing or expertise they originally claimed, and it became clear that the project was not feasible,'' Mr. McArdle said.

Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut was able to beat back a fierce challenge last fall, but now his critics are joining the very party he created to win his way back to Washington for a fourth term.
Shortly after the November election, John M. Orman, a professor of politics at Fairfield University who ran briefly against Mr. Lieberman, filed paperwork with state election officials to become the chairman of the Connecticut for Lieberman party.

Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut was able to beat back a fierce challenge last fall, but now his critics are joining the very party he created to win his way back to Washington for a fourth term.
Shortly after the November election, John M. Orman, a professor of politics at Fairfield University who ran briefly against Mr. Lieberman, filed paperwork with state election officials to become the chairman of the Connecticut for Lieberman party.
If you can't beat him, Mr. Orman reasoned, join his party to argue with him.
And this week, the secretary of state's office said that was just fine.
Mr. Lieberman created the party line last summer when it became clear he might lose the Democratic primary to Ned Lamont. By creating a minor party, Mr. Lieberman was assured a higher ballot position than if he had run as an individual, but neither he nor his supporters said that they planned to keep the party active or join it themselves. Instead, Mr. Lieberman pledged to remain a Democrat if re-elected.
As it turned out, Mr. Lieberman, who lost the primary but won the general election handily, later said that his party identification was not that simple, and asked to be called an ''Independent Democrat'' -- something that agitated his already vocal band of opponents.
''It was a joke,'' Mr. Orman said of Mr. Lieberman's political party. ''There was a mockery of the system. I expected the secretary of state to say this was a mockery. But none of that happened.''
Mr. Orman is the lone member of the party. But after an article about his move appeared in The Stamford Advocate on Wednesday, he said he received dozens of calls and e-mail messages from people asking to join. Under the rules, Mr. Orman said, any critic of Mr. Lieberman, or even someone who shares Mr. Lieberman's last name would be eligible.
Under state law, control of the party can be challenged in court. But Mr. Lieberman, who was at the Capitol on Wednesday for the inauguration of Gov. M. Jodi Rell, said he had no plans to take legal action.
''We haven't thought about the party,'' he said. ''That party won't have anything to do until six years from now.''
Not if Mr. Orman has his way. He plans to hold regular meetings to critique Mr. Lieberman. And if the past is any guide, such meetings are not likely to be quiet affairs.

Casting her first full term as governor as a chance to guide the state through a ''crossroads of needed economic, social, cultural and educational change,'' M. Jodi Rell was sworn in as Connecticut's 87th governor on Wednesday, promising to ''lead'' and ''inspire.''
In her eight-minute speech, Mrs. Rell, a Republican who was elected in a landslide victory last fall, promised to work with Democrats who control the State Legislature to address a litany of issues including education reform, soaring property taxes and energy prices, and costly health care.
Gov. M. Jodi Rell of Connecticut promised to work with Democrats on education reform, soaring property taxes and energy prices, and costly health care.
Casting her first full term as governor as a chance to guide the state through a ''crossroads of needed economic, social, cultural and educational change,'' M. Jodi Rell was sworn in as Connecticut's 87th governor on Wednesday, promising to ''lead'' and ''inspire.''
In her eight-minute speech, Mrs. Rell, a Republican who was elected in a landslide victory last fall, promised to work with Democrats who control the State Legislature to address a litany of issues including education reform, soaring property taxes and energy prices, and costly health care.
But while she offered an optimistic assessment of the future, Mrs. Rell did not say how she planned to address those problems.
''As your governor, I will forcefully lend my voice, freely share my vision, and help to shape a Connecticut that is yet to be,'' said Mrs. Rell, 60. ''I will guard the public's trust and continue to do honor to public service.''
Mrs. Rell assumed the governor's office two and half years ago after John G. Rowland resigned amid a federal corruption investigation and an impeachment inquiry. At the time, Mrs. Rell took her oath in a somber ceremony in which she promised to restore trust.
The governor's message was much the same on Wednesday, although with much more pomp. Before taking the oath of office in the atrium of the Legislative Office Building, Mrs. Rell marched in a parade with her husband, Lou, their son, Michael, and their daughter, Meredith. They moved through the streets surrounding the Capitol as dozens of state workers and supporters cheered her on.
''You'll do anything to get out of work,'' Mrs. Rell said.
The parade, with a 19-gun salute and marching bands, and a black-tie ball Wednesday evening, were the first elaborate inauguration events held here in nearly a decade. But Ms. Rell broke from tradition by not addressing state lawmakers in a joint session on their first day of the legislative calendar.
Her aides indicated that she would present legislators with more concrete plans when she introduced her budget next month. The Democrats hold a veto-proof majority in both legislative chambers and have indicated that they will push for instituting universal health care and reducing energy costs, which are among the highest in the nation.
While Ms. Rell said that the state would have to address such problems, she hinted that she would probably support small steps rather than dramatic proposals.
''There is a great yearning in our state -- a yearning for change, for improvement and also for greater equality,'' she said. ''And there is also a yearning for stability, for preserving the history, the tradition and the uniqueness of Connecticut-- a yearning, a conflict between change and constancy.''
In a day marked largely by ceremony rather than debates over policy, James A. Amann, the House speaker, said that Ms. Rell had delivered a message most residents were eager to hear.
''I actually liked the speech,'' said Mr. Amann, a Democrat. ''She tried to tell people that the sun is rising on Connecticut, not setting. People want to hear that.''

Insider Gets Manager's Post<center></b></head><p align="left">Ban Ki-moon, on second day as secretary general, appoints high-level United Nations insider, Alicia Barcena Ibarra, to top management post; because Barcena Ibarra has little administrative experience, move is seen as sign Ban does not plan aggressive reforms in much-criticized bureaucracy (M)
Ban Ki-moon, on his second day as secretary general, appointed a high-level United Nations insider, Alicia Bárcena Ibarra, to the top management post, a signal that he does not plan aggressive reforms in the much-criticized bureaucracy.
Ms. Bárcena, 54, is a career diplomat from Mexico who served for most of last year as the chief of staff for Kofi Annan, Mr. Ban's predecessor. Before that, since July 2003, Ms. Bárcena had been the deputy executive secretary of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, a United Nations development agency based in Chile.
The appointment signaled that Secretary General Ban Ki-moon does not plan aggressive reforms in the much-criticized bureaucracy.
Ban Ki-moon, on his second day as secretary general, appointed a high-level United Nations insider, Alicia Bárcena Ibarra, to the top management post, a signal that he does not plan aggressive reforms in the much-criticized bureaucracy.
Ms. Bárcena, 54, is a career diplomat from Mexico who served for most of last year as the chief of staff for Kofi Annan, Mr. Ban's predecessor. Before that, since July 2003, Ms. Bárcena had been the deputy executive secretary of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, a United Nations development agency based in Chile.
United Nations diplomats pointed out that Ms. Bárcena, although a well-regarded diplomat, had little of the front-line administrative experience needed to run the unwieldy United Nations system, which employs 16,500 people worldwide.
Her appointment marked the first time since 1992 that her position, under secretary general for management, has not been held by an American. In years past, the United States government has battled for the position, but this time Washington is lobbying instead for the top policy-making job, under secretary general for political affairs.
Several diplomats said the choice of Ms. Bárcena cast doubt on statements Mr. Ban made on Tuesday, when he said in a meeting with United Nations staff members that he wanted to overhaul ''the working culture'' of the organization.
''It's a missed opportunity in terms of having a clean break from the Kofi Annan era,'' said one Security Council diplomat. ''It would have made sense if she had immense financial and management experience. But to the contrary, she doesn't.''
But the announcement cited Ms. Bárcena's broad knowledge of the sprawling United Nations organization. She has also worked closely with Mr. Ban during the transition from Mr. Annan's leadership, and Mr. Ban has said he will appoint more women to senior positions.
''He has set his agenda, and I am sure that Ms. Bárcena agrees with that agenda,'' said Michèle Montas, Mr. Ban's spokeswoman.
The management post had been filled since June 2005 by Christopher B. Burnham, a former Marine Corps reserve colonel and investment banker. Under his tenure, the United Nations adopted new protections for whistleblowers, formed an ethics office, updated its financial disclosure policies and reorganized the procurement department, which has been the target of several criminal fraud indictments. Mr. Burnham stepped down in November.
In the meeting Tuesday with Mr. Ban, Stephen Kisambira, the president of the staff members' union, said the United Nations needed ''a fundamental change in the mindset of senior management'' from a current approach that he said was based on ''dominance, disregard and fear.''
Mr. Ban also appointed Sir John Holmes, the British ambassador to France, as under secretary general for humanitarian affairs and coordinator of emergency relief.

A soldier from the 101st Airborne Division is scheduled to plead guilty next Tuesday to a reduced charge for mercy killing in connection with the death of three unarmed Iraqi men shot by American infantrymen last spring, according to lawyers for other defendants in the case.
The terms of the plea arrangement will allow the soldier, Specialist Juston R. Graber, originally charged with capital murder, to be convicted of aggravated assault and to receive a nine-month prison sentence in exchange for his testifying against three other members of his squad, the lawyers said.
The terms of the plea arrangement will allow the soldier, originally charged with capital murder, to be convicted of aggravated assault in exchange for his testimony.
A soldier from the 101st Airborne Division is scheduled to plead guilty next Tuesday to a reduced charge for mercy killing in connection with the death of three unarmed Iraqi men shot by American infantrymen last spring, according to lawyers for other defendants in the case.
The terms of the plea arrangement will allow the soldier, Specialist Juston R. Graber, originally charged with capital murder, to be convicted of aggravated assault and to receive a nine-month prison sentence in exchange for his testifying against three other members of his squad, the lawyers said.
The three other soldiers, members of the same company as Specialist Graber in the division's Third Brigade, still face courts-martial on premeditated-murder charges, making them eligible for the death penalty or, barring that, life in prison. Army prosecutors have accused them of carrying out an impromptu plan, following a raid on a marshy island northwest of Baghdad, to kill the three Iraqis after cutting off their plastic handcuffs and forcing them to run, still blindfolded, from the squalid hut where they had been discovered.
The two soldiers accused of firing on the men as they fled -- Specialist William B. Hunsaker and Pfc. Corey R. Clagett -- have said they shot in self-defense after the three broke free from the thin ''zip-tie'' handcuffs and attacked them.
A third soldier, Staff Sgt. Raymond L. Girouard, the squad's ranking member, is accused of devising the plan to kill the men, then punching Private Clagett and cutting Specialist Hunsaker to give the appearance that they had been attacked.
None of these three defendants have entered a formal pea.
The guilty plea by Specialist Graber, to be entered before an Army judge at Fort Campbell, Ky., and his testimony against the other soldiers will make gaining their acquittal far more difficult than it would have been had all four kept a unified legal front, lawyers for the three others said.
''It changes the complexion of the entire case and makes the case much stronger against Clagett, Hunsaker and Girouard,'' said Paul Bergrin, a lawyer for Private Clagett who said he had not expected Specialist Graber to get ''such an outstanding deal.''
''It gives the government's case credibility and corroboration where they didn't have it before,'' Mr. Bergrin added. ''It requires us to rethink our strategy.''
Specialist Graber's two military lawyers, Capt. Shaun Lister and Capt. Will Suddeth, did not reply to e-mailed requests for comment or phone messages left with military officials at Fort Hood, Tex., where both are based. Their client's willingness to testify for the prosecution, though, was bitter news to the three other defendants.
Michael Waddington, a lawyer for Specialist Hunsaker, said Specialist Graber's plea arrangement felt like a betrayal, ''especially when we've been disclosing our strategy'' to his lawyers for months. Specialist Graber's legal team had joined with Mr. Waddington, Mr. Bergrin and Capt. Ted Miller, a lawyer for Sergeant Girouard, in a collaborative pact known as a joint defense agreement, which lawyers often create if their clients face similar charges in the same incident.
Defense lawyers said Specialist Graber's plea was not particularly surprising, given the disparity between the evidence against him and the charges he had faced.
According to the evidence, Specialist Graber made a last-second decision to shoot the dying man after a squad medic declared him beyond help and, according to sworn statements from soldiers not charged in the case, after Sergeant Girouard said, ''Put him out of his misery.''
But Army prosecutors nonetheless charged Specialist Graber, 21, with premeditated murder, creating an enormous incentive, defense lawyers for the three other soldiers said, for him to plead guilty to a lesser charge that more closely fit the crime.
The first court-martial in the case will be Private Clagett's, scheduled to begin Jan. 15 at Fort Campbell, Mr. Bergrin said. Two other soldiers, Sgt. Leonel Lemus and Pfc. Bradley Mason, are expected to testify for the prosecution that they heard Sergeant Girouard conceive a plan to free the Iraqi men from their handcuffs and have Private Clagett and Specialist Hunsaker kill them.
But Mr. Bergrin said he would call a powerful witness of his own: Col. Michael Steele, the brigade commander, who, according to several soldiers' sworn testimony, told some soldiers to ''kill all military-age males'' they encountered during the raid, on May 9.
Colonel Steele's lawyer, Lt. Col. Raymond A. Jackson, said on Wednesday that Colonel Steele had never given such an order, a denial putting him at odds with several soldiers under his command.
The Army has granted Colonel Steele immunity to testify, Mr. Bergrin said, and once on the stand and under oath, ''he's going to have to tell the truth.''
Correction:  January 5, 2007, Friday  An article yesterday about a guilty plea by Army Specialist Juston R. Graber to a reduced charge of mercy killing in connection with the deaths of three Iraqi men misstated the original charge against him and the maximum punishment three other soldiers could receive if convicted. Specialist Graber was charged with noncapital murder, not capital murder. The three other soldiers scheduled for courts-martial face life in prison -- not the death penalty -- if convicted.

A student shot and killed another student at a public high school here on Wednesday, and the accused gunman was arrested a few hours later while walking down a nearby street, the police said.
The shooting happened just before 7:30 a.m. in a hallway outside classrooms at Foss High School, as students waited for a bell to signal the start of classes on the first day back after winter break. Several students reported hearing multiple gunshots and seeing blood on hallway lockers as the victim slumped to the floor. Many students and teachers took cover beneath tables.
Police said the accused gunman appeared to single out his victim.

Several students reported hearing multiple gunshots and seeing blood on hallway lockers as the victim slumped to the floor. Many students and teachers took cover beneath tables.
The victim was identified by the Pierce County medical examiner as Samnang Kok, 17. The police did not identify the suspect but said he was 18 and had no prior record. They said he appeared to single out his victim and did not fire shots at anyone else. Pierce County jail records showed that Douglas S. Chanthabouly, 18, was booked for investigation of first-degree murder, and the local news media identified him as the suspect. Detectives were interviewing the suspect to try to determine a motive, and the police said the shooting did not appear to be gang related.
''The last word we got from the guys doing the investigation was they had no idea,'' said Mark Fulghum, a spokesman for the Tacoma Police Department.
Chief Don Ramsdell said: ''Not too far from here, they were able to locate the subject just walking down the street. He was taken into custody without incident. There was a weapon recovered, unknown if that was the actual weapon.''
Foss High School, which has about 1,700 students, does not have metal detectors but does employ private security guards, said Chris Taylor, a police detective.School was canceled after the shooting.

The sex-related entertainment industry's leading performers, owners and fans gather in Las Vegas for three conferences starting next week amid indications that pornography's robust growth since it came out from behind the counter in the 1970s is slowing.
The sex-related entertainment business grew in 2006 by just 2.4 percent, roughly the rate of inflation, to just under $13 billion, according to Paul Fishbein, president of the AVN Media Network, which publishes five trade magazines and runs industry conferences.
The slowdown may be just the latest example of how the Internet is shaking up well-established industries.
The sex-related entertainment industry's leading performers, owners and fans gather in Las Vegas for three conferences starting next week amid indications that pornography's robust growth since it came out from behind the counter in the 1970s is slowing.
The sex-related entertainment business grew in 2006 by just 2.4 percent, roughly the rate of inflation, to just under $13 billion, according to Paul Fishbein, president of the AVN Media Network, which publishes five trade magazines and runs industry conferences.
Jerry Ropelato, an opponent of the industry who owns the Web site TopTenReviews.com, gave a slightly smaller estimate of the size of the business, about $12 billion.
''The porn industry is still growing,'' Mr. Ropelato said, ''but just not at the growth rates they experienced in the past.''
Mr. Fishbein's estimates indicate that for every dollar Americans spent buying tickets to Hollywood movies last year, they spent about 90 cents viewing sex movies in various formats.
The slowdown may be just the latest example of how the Internet is shaking up well-established industries.
Because most of the industry is privately owned, accurate numbers are hard to come by. But in one part of the industry where there is independent reporting of sales -- sex movies sold over cable -- there are indications of a slowdown.
JupiterKagan Inc., a media and technology market research company, said it expected that sex movies sold either as pay-per-view or on-demand would grow over the next decade at only half the pace of overall paid-for programming on cable.
George Niesen, managing editor of Kagan Research in Monterey, Calif., said that $1.6 billion was spent on cable pay-per-view, video-on-demand and similar services in 2006, with $515 million, or roughly a third of that, going to sex-related entertainment.
Over the next 10 years, Kagan Research projects, overall paid-for programming on cable will grow at 12.9 percent a year, while the sex-related segment's growth will be half that, at 6.4 percent.
Revenues appear to be growing in the dance club business. The industry's one publicly traded concern, Rick's Cabaret, which runs dance clubs in seven cities, said same-store sales in its fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 were up 25.1 percent over the previous year.
The idea that revenue growth has slowed for the sex-related entertainment industry was disputed by Steven Hirsch, one of three owners of the Vivid Entertainment Group, a major producer of both soft- and hard-core movies. He and other industry executives said the ways that Americans get pornography are changing, with sales of videos and magazines in decline, while sex-related entertainment over cable television and Internet streaming is growing quickly.
''Right now, DVD is going down faster than video-on-demand is ramping up; it is just a lag in technologies,'' Mr. Hirsch said, not a fundamental easing in demand.
He said he did not believe that the aging of the American population had affected sales.
The Census Bureau estimates that the average age of Americans last year was 36, up from 30 in 1980, when the industry was growing rapidly in the wake of favorable Supreme Court decisions, fewer police raids and easy access to movies through the technology of videocassettes, which were new then.
Mr. Fishbein and others said ''the one area of huge growth'' was hard-core movies featuring women in their 30s into their 70s, a trend that has brought new work for some of the industry's stars.
''The flashpoint for this in our culture was the teen movie 'American Pie,' where there is a famous sequence involving one of the kids and his friend's mother,'' Mr. Fishbein said.
Mr. Fishbein and others also said that there was big growth in sales of sex toys to women.
Outside the United States, the fastest growth is in sex videos and images sent to cellphone viewing screens, Mr. Fishbein and others said.
None of the American cellphone companies cooperate with the industry, which he said limited the market because consumers must use complicated technology to work around the cellphone networks.
Mr. Fishbein estimated domestic revenue from these cellphone sales at just $39 million.
Mr. Hirsch, the co-owner of Vivid, said such sales via cellphones in Europe were a growth center. He said he hoped that technological changes within a few years would prompt big sales in the United States, even if the cellphone companies did not cooperate.

The Iraqi prime minister's office on Wednesday mounted its first public defense of the way the government carried out the execution of Saddam Hussein, and said that Iraqi authorities had detained a guard who they believed was involved in recording the moment in a macabre and unauthorized video that has generated revulsion around the world.
Iraqi officials, in their effort to dampen the video's impact, tried to challenge the impression it conveyed that Mr. Hussein, for all his brutal crimes, had behaved with far more dignity in his final minutes than his seemingly thuggish executioners.
The arrest was in connection with the cellphone video showing Saddam Hussein being taunted before his death.
The Iraqi prime minister's office on Wednesday mounted its first public defense of the way the government carried out the execution of Saddam Hussein, and said that Iraqi authorities had detained a guard who they believed was involved in recording the moment in a macabre and unauthorized video that has generated revulsion around the world.
Iraqi officials, in their effort to dampen the video's impact, tried to challenge the impression it conveyed that Mr. Hussein, for all his brutal crimes, had behaved with far more dignity in his final minutes than his seemingly thuggish executioners.
''The execution operation has been mischaracterized for political purposes,'' said Sadiq al-Rikabi, an adviser to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, who was present at the execution. Mr. Rikabi asserted that it had been carried out properly. ''What has happened is not an insult or degradation,'' he said.
But even as Mr. Maliki's government tried to defend its actions, the United States military, which had held Mr. Hussein in custody until it transferred him to Iraqi authorities about an hour before he was hanged, sought to distance itself from any responsibility for the scenes revealed in the video.
''You know, if you're asking me, 'Would we have done things differently,' yes, we would have,'' said Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, an American military spokesman in Baghdad, at a news briefing on Wednesday.
''But that's not our decision,'' he added. ''That's an Iraqi government decision.''
The reaction from the American military seemed to widen a rift that has been opening recently between the Shiite-led government of Mr. Maliki and its American supporters on a range of issues. They include the government's tolerance of militias, the recent discovery of the unofficial presence of Iranian military officers in Baghdad and the swiftness with which the Iraqis put Mr. Hussein to death after his appeals had been exhausted.
Mr. Maliki's office confirmed Wednesday that until Mr. Hussein's final hours, the American Embassy had sought to delay the execution long enough to avoid having it on a Muslim holiday and to resolve some remaining legal issues.
''The Americans wanted to postpone it,'' said Maryam al-Rayas, a legal adviser to the prime minister. The decision to go ahead, Ms. Rayas said, was ''a victory for the Iraqi government.''
The prime minister had decided that beginning the new year with Mr. Hussein dead trumped all other considerations, including the advice of the embassy, said Ms. Rayas, who also characterized the time frame as reasonable.
''There was no rush,'' she said.
The Iraqi government's detention of one of the guards generated some skepticism, with some Iraqi officials suggesting that Iraq was seeking a low-level scapegoat to blame for the almost Gothic display of intimidation and death that the images depict.
Mr. Rikabi refused to name or otherwise characterize the guard who had been arrested other than to say that he was being held in Baghdad after an investigation had determined that he had shot the video with a cellphone camera.
But Munkith al-Faroun, who was the prosecutor at Mr. Hussein's trial and was present at the execution, has said publicly that 2 of the 14 Iraqi officials and court representatives flown in by American helicopters to witness it were openly videotaping the event with cellphones.
When asked about Mr. Faroun's statements, Mr. Rikabi said, ''I do not have this information.''
On Wednesday, The New York Times erroneously quoted Mr. Faroun as saying that one of the officials he had seen holding up a cellphone during the execution was Mowaffak al-Rubaie, Mr. Maliki's national security adviser. Mr. Rubaie, in a telephone interview from London, said that along with all the Iraqi officials who were flown to the execution block by American helicopter, he had been searched at the Green Zone helipad and that his cellphone and even his keys were taken from him.
''I did not have a cellphone in the execution chamber,'' he said.
But, further undermining the assertion that only a single guard had videotaped the execution, Mr. Rubaie said he had seen ''two or three'' others in the official contingent who did have cellphones. He suggested that they might have been among officials who arrived at Camp Justice, the American camp in northern Baghdad where the hanging took place, by car.
The failure to call more senior officials to account raised suspicions among some Iraqis. ''They want to blame it on a guard,'' one senior Iraqi official said.
Mr. Rubaie told CNN that there could have been as many as two others in the guard contingent who were associated with that scheme.
In the wake of the video's release, there were continuing condemnations of the way justice was meted out to Mr. Hussein after he lost his case in a court specially set up to judge crimes committed during his rule. On Wednesday, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Louise Arbour, renewed a previous call for restraint in carrying out the executions of two of Mr. Hussein's co-defendants who were also sentenced to death.
The manner of Mr. Hussein's execution appeared to give a boost to the remnants of his outlawed Baath Party. In the town of Huwaish, north of Baghdad, hundreds of people led by gunmen calling themselves the ''mujahedeen of the Baath Party'' marched in protest, and in the once prosperous Baghdad neighborhood of Monsour, a large black banner proclaimed that Mr. Hussein's death would set off fighting against ''the Americans and their followers.''
The banner was signed, in nicely printed lettering, ''Baath Party.''
At the same time, one of Mr. Hussein's most ruthless enforcers, Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, who has eluded his American pursuers for nearly four years, was named the Baath Party leader on one of its Web sites. Although the claim could not be independently verified, Mr. Douri has long been considered a leader of the Baathist insurgency.
Asked repeatedly to describe how the American military would have carried out the execution differently, General Caldwell declined to elaborate, saying that the question was hypothetical, since the Iraqis were in control once they received custody of Mr. Hussein outside the execution block.
''It was not our decision as to what occurred at that point, but we would have done it differently,'' General Caldwell said.
Still, Mr. Rikabi, the prime minister's political adviser, said that the government rejected all criticism of the execution, including the point at which one of the guards shouted, ''Moktada! Moktada! Moktada!'' as Mr. Hussein stood on the trapdoor of the gallows -- a reference to Moktada al-Sadr, the radical Shiite cleric who leads the militia called the Mahdi Army.
The exclamation came at the end of a standard Muslim prayer that both the guards and Mr. Hussein were saying aloud, Mr. Rikabi said. But the guards were from the Shiite south, where Mr. Sadr is popular, and the prayer there typically ends with the reference to him, Mr. Rikabi said.
''If you go to any mosque in Karbala or Najaf you will hear them shouting like that,'' he said. ''This is their habit.''
Seemingly contradicting his own government, Mr. Rubaie said he was ashamed of what had happened during the execution, which he described as ''unacceptable'' and ''disgusting.''
''It is not professional, it's the wrong thing to do, and it should not have happened,'' he said. ''But it shouldn't divert the mind of the people from the crimes that Saddam has been condemned to death for.''

Some key Senate Democrats say they could consider supporting a short-term increase in American troop levels in Iraq, a stance that reflects division within the party and could provide an opening for President Bush as he prepares to announce his revised plan for Iraq as early as next week.
Mr. Bush is expected to outline a strategy that would include adding to American forces, but would link that increase to a plan for economic development in Iraq. He has vowed to consult Congressional leaders before delivering his speech to the nation, and he began that process on Wednesday night by inviting House and Senate leaders to a White House reception, though officials said Iraq was not discussed.

Some key Senate Democrats say they could consider supporting a short-term increase in American troop levels in Iraq, a stance that reflects division within the party and could provide an opening for President Bush as he prepares to announce his revised plan for Iraq as early as next week.
Mr. Bush is expected to outline a strategy that would include adding to American forces, but would link that increase to a plan for economic development in Iraq. He has vowed to consult Congressional leaders before delivering his speech to the nation, and he began that process on Wednesday night by inviting House and Senate leaders to a White House reception, though officials said Iraq was not discussed.
Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who will lead the Armed Services Committee, said he would not ''prejudge'' the president's proposal. While he would oppose an open-ended commitment, Mr. Levin said, he would not rule out supporting a plan to dispatch more troops if the proposal was tied to a broader strategy to begin reducing American involvement and sending troops home.
''The American people are skeptical about getting in deeper,'' he said in an interview. ''But if it's truly conditional upon the Iraqis' actually meeting milestones and if it's part of an overall program of troop reduction that would begin in the next four to six months, it's something that would be worth considering.''
But Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Delaware Democrat who will become chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has said he is opposed to increasing troop strength regardless of the plan, calling the idea the ''absolute wrong strategy.'' In interviews on Wednesday, several Democratic senators echoed Mr. Biden's view, saying they believed that sending more troops would not resolve the predicament in Iraq.
Democrats have become well-practiced at playing the roles of critic and skeptic, particularly when the subject is the war in Iraq. But as the party formally assumes control of Congress on Thursday, the divisions between the committee leaders, party leadership and rank-and-file senators illustrate the fresh burden they face of articulating a response to Mr. Bush's revised Iraq strategy.
Democrats may find it difficult to speak with one voice in response to Mr. Bush's plan. And at this point, party strategists said, they do not necessarily intend to. Over the next three weeks, Senate Democrats plan to call at least 13 hearings on Iraq, to be held by committees that include Foreign Relations, Armed Services, Intelligence, Homeland Security and Judiciary.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates have agreed to testify, officials said, and invitations were sent this week to a raft of former administration officials, academics and military and Iraqi experts.
Short of reducing military financing, which even the staunchest Congressional war critics have been reluctant to do, Democrats say they believe that one of the most effective tools they have to influence policy is to hold televised hearings.
''What you are going to find is that this is no longer exclusively a Democratic criticism,'' said Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who is a member of the Armed Services Committee. ''A lot of Republicans are going to be standing up and saying, 'I don't understand what the president's strategy is.' A lot of people will be asking serious questions, and that will be healthy.''
Senator Evan Bayh, an Indiana Democrat who also serves on the Armed Services Committee, said a troop increase ''might lead to a temporary abatement to the violence, but will only postpone the ultimate day of reckoning.''
In an interview, Mr. Bayh added, ''This problem is not going to be solved in Washington by the president of the United States; it can only be resolved by Iraqis.''
In a memorandum sent Wednesday to members of the Democratic caucus, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, who becomes the majority leader, pledged that ''Democrats will work with Republicans to bring oversight and accountability'' to the war.
Mr. Reid has said that he will consider supporting a short-term increase in troops, but his spokesman, Jim Manley, declared, ''If it's not temporary in nature, it's a nonstarter.''
Representative Steny H. Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat who will be the House majority leader, stopped short of saying that Democrats would exercise the power of the purse and decrease financing for American troops. Yet he said the new Congress was ''not going to sit silently by while policies are pursued with which we don't agree.''
Still, the Bush administration intends to try to find support from the crop of newly elected members of Congress -- particularly those who were elected from Republican districts -- as the president works to build support for his Iraq strategy before the State of the Union address, now set for Jan. 23.
On the issue of sending more troops to Iraq, the White House is also reaching out to Senate Democrats who are facing re-election in 2008.
''I am not in favor of that unless the president can convince me otherwise,'' Senator Mark Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat who will serve on the Armed Services Committee, said of a possible troop increase.
''I think that the Congress, after 9/11, was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt on a whole range of issues related to Iraq,'' Mr. Pryor said, ''but we've been there four years now and it's time for him to clearly have the burden of proof.''

207 <html><head><b><center>Another Thousand Lives<center></b></head><p align="left">Bob Herbert Op-Ed column lambastes Pres Bush for his refusal to withdraw troops from Iraq; says more than 3,000 American troops have been killed in war of futility and that American public no longer supports US involvement in Iraq; calls on politicians to take action rather than watching helplessly as Bush administration continues to commit troops (M)
How long can this go on?
Saddam is dead. The weapons of mass destruction were a mirage. More than 3,000 American G.I.s and scores of thousands of Iraqis have been killed. Voters in the United States have made it clear that they no longer support American involvement in this exercise in sustained barbarism. Incredibly, the U.S. military itself is turning against the war.
We should end our participation in the feast of death in Iraq.
How long can this go on?
Saddam is dead. The weapons of mass destruction were a mirage. More than 3,000 American G.I.s and scores of thousands of Iraqis have been killed. Voters in the United States have made it clear that they no longer support American involvement in this exercise in sustained barbarism. Incredibly, the U.S. military itself is turning against the war.
And yet the president, against the counsel of his commanders on the ground, apparently is ready to escalate -- to send more American lives into the fire he set in Iraq.
In a devastating critique of the war, the newsweekly Army Times led its current edition with the headline: ''About-Face on the War -- After 3 years of support, troops sour on Iraq.'' The article detailed a Military Times Poll that found, for the first time, that ''more troops disapprove of the president's handling of the war than approve of it.''
Only a third of the service members surveyed approved of the president's conduct of the war, while 42 percent disapproved. Perhaps worse was the finding that only half of the troops believed that success in Iraq was likely.
The service members made it clear that they were not attacking their commander in chief personally. His overall approval rating remained high. What has turned them off has been the wretched reality of the war. In the article, David Segal, director of the Center for Research on Military Organization at the University of Maryland, said, ''They're seeing more casualties and fatalities and less progress.''
In other words, they're seeing the same thing everybody else is seeing -- except, perhaps, Mr. Bush.
On New Year's Day, readers of The New York Times could see the excruciating photo layout of the latest 1,000 American service members to die in Iraq. As in all wars, most of them were young. Many of them were smiling in the photos. All of them died unnecessarily.
The war has been an exercise in futility and mind-boggling incompetence, and yet our involvement continues -- with no end in sight, no plans for withdrawal, no idea of where we might be headed -- as if the U.S. had fallen into some kind of bizarrely destructive trance from which it is unable to awaken.
And who is paying the price for this insanity -- apart from ordinary Iraqis, who are paying the most grievous price of all? The burden of the war in the U.S. is being shouldered overwhelmingly by a contingent of Americans whom no one would categorize as economically privileged.
As Lizette Alvarez and Andrew Lehren wrote in Monday's Times:
''The service members who died during this latest period fit an unchanging profile. They were mostly white men from rural areas, soldiers so young they still held fresh memories of high school football heroics and teenage escapades. Many men and women were in Iraq for the second or third time. Some were going on their fourth, fifth or sixth deployment.''
There is no way that this can be justified. It is just wrong.
I've said many times that if a war is worth fighting the way to do it is to mobilize the entire country, drawing the warriors from as wide a swath of the population as possible and raising taxes on everyone as part of an all-out effort to defeat a common enemy.
This war is not worth fighting. And if there were ever serious talk about enacting a draft or raising taxes to fight it, you'd see quickly enough that the vast majority of Americans would not find it worth fighting.
There must be a leader somewhere who can shake the U.S. out of this tragic hypnotic state, who can see that it is beyond crazy to continue our involvement in this war indefinitely, to sacrifice another 1,000 young lives, and then another thousand after that.
All of the tortured, twisted rationales for this war -- all of the fatuous intellectual pyrotechnics dreamed up to justify it -- have vaporized, and we're left with just the mad, mindless, meaningless and apparently endless slaughter.
Shakespeare, in ''Henry VI,'' said: ''Now thou art come unto a feast of death.''
We should end our participation in the feast of death in Iraq. It is criminal to continue feeding our troops into the slaughter.
If there were politicians here at home with some of the courage of the troops in the field, we could begin saving lives rather than watching helplessly as the Bush White House continues to sacrifice them. Three thousand and counting is enough.

THIS week the United States government will begin automatically declassifying hundreds of millions of documents from the cold war, under a law meant to streamline the cost and hassle of keeping secret files that are more than 25 years old. Among the dossiers bearing names like Alger Hiss, Theodore Hall and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg will be one labeled ''Frigyes Klein'': my father, Fred Klein.
My father was never a spy, never a member of the Communist Party. He came by ship to the United States in 1956, fleeing Communism during the Hungarian revolution to pursue the American dream. He worked on a Ford automobile assembly line in Cincinnati by day and moonlighted sharpening lawnmowers at night, saving enough money in a few years to buy a small house. To him, treasonous behavior meant buying a car made outside of America. Nonetheless, as I discovered recently, the F.B.I. kept a file on him from the day he arrived in the United States.

To him, treasonous behavior meant buying a car made outside of America. Nonetheless, as I discovered recently, the F.B.I. kept a file on him from the day he arrived in the United States.
J. Edgar Hoover sent a personal memo to the C.I.A. director calling my father a person of current interest; the case was handled by Alan Belmont, a top bureau official who was instrumental in the case against the Rosenbergs. I discovered this after filing a Freedom of Information Act inquiry as part of some family research for a book. I was shocked to receive 50 F.B.I. pages riddled with my father's name, the edges dotted with weathered stamps marked ''SECRET.'' I matched what I read with stories I remembered from when he was alive, and began piecing the case together.
My father once mentioned that during the voyage over, he got into an altercation with another refugee, a man he didn't know from a town he had never visited. According to the file, this man told an Army captain that my father had been an agent for AVO -- the Hungarian K.G.B. -- in his town of Tatabanya, that he had interrogated and beaten the man for speaking out against the regime, and that he'd subsequently sent the man to a prison camp. The story was a complete fabrication.
I can only imagine how many names of patriotic, law-abiding Eastern European immigrants like my father are to be found in the millions of documents being released by the F.B.I. and other agencies. In a recent article in this newspaper about the declassification law, L. Britt Snider, a former intelligence official who is advising the White House on the process, warned that most of the documents were boring and suggested that the agencies concentrate first on those that were interesting and important.
But I would caution intelligence officials not to discount both the interest and the importance of files like my father's, if only to avoid repeating some of the embarrassing legacies of the cold-war era.
It has already happened. Last year a Syrian informant told the New York police that five Arabs he knew were importing weapons for a suicide bombing. After several weeks and the involvement of more than 30 New York police agents, as well as federal customs officials, the F.B.I. and Israeli law enforcement, it was determined that the ''weapons'' were in fact jewelry. As with my father, the informant had a vendetta and had lied to the authorities.
My father's case remained open for more than a decade. His F.B.I. file contains a creepy secret memo from 1963 in which a mole inside the Hungarian community in Cincinnati reported to his handler that he had ''heard rumors [about] a family named Klein who do not associate with the Hungarian group.'' The fact that this level of surveillance was taking place behind my family's back seven years after they arrived in America says something about the pathological level of paranoia during the Red Scare.
The Frigyes Klein file was finally closed in 1968, only after people from the informant's Hungarian hometown admitted to an F.B.I. special agent that my father had not been with the secret police. Twenty-five years from now, some unsuspecting son may stumble across a file about his own father -- a patriotic, law-abiding Arab immigrant whose name inexplicably ended up on a list. Like the cold-war-era files, these new ones being drawn up could leave a historical paper trail about an era of scares and witch hunts -- if intelligence officials do not learn from the lessons in the documents released today.

THE Iraq Study Group report was released into a sea of unrealistic expectations. Inevitably, it disappointed hopes for a clear path through the morass of Iraq, because there is no ''silver bullet'' solution to the difficulties in which we find ourselves.
But the report accomplished a great deal. It brought together some of America's best minds across party lines, and it outlined with clarity and precision the key factors at issue in Iraq. In doing so, it helped catalyze the debate about our Iraq policy and crystallize the choices we face. Above all, it emphasized the importance of focusing on American national interests, not only in Iraq but in the region.
What is at stake is not only Iraq and the stability of the Middle East, but the global perception of the reliability of the United States as a partner in a deeply troubled world.
THE Iraq Study Group report was released into a sea of unrealistic expectations. Inevitably, it disappointed hopes for a clear path through the morass of Iraq, because there is no ''silver bullet'' solution to the difficulties in which we find ourselves.
But the report accomplished a great deal. It brought together some of America's best minds across party lines, and it outlined with clarity and precision the key factors at issue in Iraq. In doing so, it helped catalyze the debate about our Iraq policy and crystallize the choices we face. Above all, it emphasized the importance of focusing on American national interests, not only in Iraq but in the region.
However, the report, which calls the situation in Iraq ''grave and deteriorating,'' does not focus on what could be the most likely outcome of its analysis. Should the Iraqis be unable or unwilling to play the role required of them, the report implies that we would have no choice but to withdraw, and then blame our withdrawal on Iraqi failures. But here the report essentially stops.
An American withdrawal before Iraq can, in the words of the president, ''govern itself, sustain itself, and defend itself'' would be a strategic defeat for American interests, with potentially catastrophic consequences both in the region and beyond. Our opponents would be hugely emboldened, our friends deeply demoralized.
Iran, heady with the withdrawal of its principal adversary, would expand its influence through Hezbollah and Hamas more deeply into Syria, Lebanon, the Palestinian territories and Jordan. Our Arab friends would rightly feel we had abandoned them to face alone a radicalism that has been greatly inflamed by American actions in the region and which could pose a serious threat to their own governments.
The effects would not be confined to Iraq and the Middle East. Energy resources and transit choke points vital to the global economy would be subjected to greatly increased risk. Terrorists and extremists elsewhere would be emboldened. And the perception, worldwide, would be that the American colossus had stumbled, was losing its resolve and could no longer be considered a reliable ally or friend -- or the guarantor of peace and stability in this critical region.
To avoid these dire consequences, we need to secure the support of the countries of the region themselves. It is greatly in their self-interest to give that support, just as they did in the 1991 Persian Gulf conflict. Unfortunately, in recent years they have come to see it as dangerous to identify with the United States, and so they have largely stood on the sidelines.
A vigorously renewed effort to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict could fundamentally change both the dynamics in the region and the strategic calculus of key leaders. Real progress would push Iran into a more defensive posture. Hezbollah and Hamas would lose their rallying principle. American allies like Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the gulf states would be liberated to assist in stabilizing Iraq. And Iraq would finally be seen by all as a key country that had to be set right in the pursuit of regional security.
Arab leaders are now keen to resolve the 50-year-old dispute. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel may be as well. His nation's long-term security can only be assured by resolving this issue once and for all. However, only the American president can bring them to the same table.
Resuming the Arab-Israeli peace process is not a matter of forcing concessions from Israel or dragooning the Palestinians into surrender. Most of the elements of a settlement are already agreed as a result of the negotiations of 2000 and the ''road map'' of 2002. What is required is to summon the will of Arab and Israeli leaders, led by a determined American president, to forge the various elements into a conclusion that all parties have already publicly accepted in principle.
As for Syria and Iran, we should not be afraid of opening channels of communication, but neither should we rush to engage them as negotiating ''partners.'' Moreover, these two countries have differing interests, expectations and points of leverage and should not be treated as though they are indistinguishable.
Syria cannot be comfortable clutched solely in the embrace of Iran, and thus prying it away may be possible. Syria also has much to gain from a settlement with Israel and internal problems that such a deal might greatly ease. If we can make progress on the Palestinian front before adding Syria to the mix, it would both avoid overloading Israel's negotiating capacity and increase the incentives for Damascus to negotiate seriously.
Iran is different. It may not be wise to make Iran integral to the regional strategy at the outset. And the nuclear issue should be dealt with on a separate track. In its present state of euphoria, Iran has little interest in making things easier for us. If, however, we make clear our determination, and if the other regional states become more engaged in stabilizing Iraq, the Iranians might grow more inclined to negotiate seriously.
WHILE negotiations on the Arab-Israel peace process are under way, we should establish some political parameters inside Iraq that encourage moves toward reconciliation and unified government in Iraq. Other suggested options, such as an ''80 percent solution'' that excludes the Sunnis, or the division of the country into three parts, are not only inconsistent with reconciliation but would almost certainly pave the way to broader regional conflict and must be avoided.
American combat troops should be gradually redeployed away from intervening in sectarian conflict. That necessarily is a task for Iraqi troops, however poorly prepared they may be. Our troops should be redirected toward training the Iraqi Army, providing support and backup, combating insurgents, attenuating outside intervention and assisting in major infrastructure protection.
That does not mean the American presence should be reduced. Indeed, in the immediate future, the opposite may be true, though any increase in troop strength should be directed at accomplishing specific, defined missions. A generalized increase would be unlikely to demonstrably change the situation and, consequently, could result in increased clamor for withdrawal. But the central point is that withdrawing combat forces should not be a policy objective, but rather, the result of changes in our strategy and success in our efforts.
As we work our way through this seemingly intractable problem in Iraq, we must constantly remember that this is not just a troublesome issue from which we can walk away if it seems too costly to continue. What is at stake is not only Iraq and the stability of the Middle East, but the global perception of the reliability of the United States as a partner in a deeply troubled world. We cannot afford to fail that test.

Saddam Hussein deserves no one's pity. But as anyone who has seen the graphic cellphone video of his hanging can testify, his execution bore little resemblance to dispassionate, state-administered justice. The condemned dictator appeared to have been delivered from United States military custody into the hands of a Shiite lynch mob.
For the Bush administration, which insists it went to war in Iraq to implant democracy and justice, those globally viewed images were a shaming embarrassment. Unfortunately, all Americans will be blamed, while the Iraqi people are now likely to suffer still more. What should have been a symbolic passage out of Iraq's darkest era will instead fuel a grim new era of spiraling sectarian vengeance.

Unfortunately, all Americans will be blamed, while the Iraqi people are now likely to suffer still more. What should have been a symbolic passage out of Iraq's darkest era will instead fuel a grim new era of spiraling sectarian vengeance.
The ugly episode shows why Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki is never likely to produce the national unity government that Washington keeps demanding and that Iraq so desperately needs.
Mr. Maliki is now scrambling to extricate himself from the public relations disaster. Yesterday, his office announced the arrest of a guard who allegedly took the unauthorized video. But the fundamental blame belongs to Mr. Maliki, who personally orchestrated the timing and circumstances of last Saturday's execution.
Mr. Maliki ignored pleas for delay from Washington and the legal niceties of Iraq's Constitution. He rushed to deliver Mr. Hussein's death as a holiday gift to his hard-line Shiite constituency, especially followers of the radical cleric and militia leader Moktada al-Sadr, who were allowed to chant abuse at the condemned dictator while he stood at the gallows with the noose around his neck.
Mr. Maliki's usual cheerleaders, President Bush and Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, have distanced themselves from this repellent spectacle. Yet the Bush administration again finds that it has little credibility to lecture anyone on the basic dignity due to detainees. The Washington Post reported yesterday on an internal F.B.I. investigation that revealed a pattern of deliberate taunting of the religious beliefs of Muslim prisoners at Guantánamo.
As Mr. Bush prepares his latest plan for Iraq, he must face up to bleak realities. As of January, 2007, Iraq lacks an army capable of standing on its own. It lacks a justice system that puts the rule of law over political expediency, while its police force is dominated by sectarian militias and thugs. Most crucially, it lacks a government committed to protect the rights and personal safety of all Iraqis.
Most Americans, whatever their view of the war, understand that the rule of Saddam Hussein brought a murderous curse and untold suffering upon the Iraqi people. Mr. Hussein has now gone to his grave. But the outrageous manner of his killing, deliberately mimicking his own depraved methods, assures that his cruelty will outlive him.

The nation should welcome the ambitious agenda being offered today by the new Congress's Democratic majority, from raising the minimum wage to advancing stem cell research to restoring oversight of the executive branch. But the real test for the 110th Congress will be its willingness to clean up its own act by adopting forceful and credible ethics reform. That is what the Democratic leadership promised voters. Any hesitation will be rightly seen as a cynical re-endorsement of the Capitol's lobbyist-enabling, corruption-steeped business as usual.
Congress's ethics rules have been rife with loopholes and wrist-slapping punishments that grease rather than police the quid pro quo world of Washington. Fixing some of these problems requires nothing more than a majority vote on the House or Senate rules.

Congress's ethics rules have been rife with loopholes and wrist-slapping punishments that grease rather than police the quid pro quo world of Washington. Fixing some of these problems requires nothing more than a majority vote on the House or Senate rules.
House Democrats appear ready to start with a firm, and long needed, ban on gifts, entertainment and junket travel -- including low-cost V.I.P. rides on corporate jets -- arranged by lobbyists or their clients. The ban should cover staffers as well, and the Senate should match it. Even that will require wary monitoring, particularly of a provision that would allow members preapproved day trips for speeches, with travel paid by non-lobbying groups.
Both houses should also bar Congressional alumni and other lobbyists from the debating floors and other Capitol inner sanctums. And members of Congress with other ambitions should be blocked from slyly negotiating lucrative private jobs while they're still on the public's payroll and sworn to defend the public's interest. There should be early disclosure of all job feelers.
The back-scratching closeness of politicians seeking campaign donations and deep-pocket interests seeking favors is a capital disgrace. Part of the solution is to douse their dealings with sunshine through prompt and detailed filing disclosures. And there should be full disclosure of the cornucopia of ''earmarks'' -- costly favors inserted without debate or any requirement to disclose authorship in mammoth spending bills. Earmark authors and beneficiaries should be unmasked in time to be mocked by taxpayers.
Broader reforms will require longer legislative debate, not just a rule change. Paramount is the need to create an independent office for ethics enforcement to end the clubbiness that more often than not covers up or excuses abuses. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has ordered a bipartisan study of this vital proposal by March. We expect this overdue step to receive the forceful support of Ms. Pelosi and Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader. The voters are watching, and lawmakers dare not slip away from the promise to clean up their act.

New Yorkers have long rolled their eyes when politicians, TV commercials and after-dinner speakers endlessly extolled ''small-town values.'' The truth is that integrity, compassion and heroism are no scarcer on the sidewalks of Chicago or Harlem than they are in Dubuque. If anyone doubts this, they should consider Wesley Autrey's heroic turn at the 137th Street and Broadway subway station this week.
Mr. Autrey, a construction worker who lives in the neighborhood, was riding the subway with his 6- and 4-year-old daughters when a young film student had a seizure on the platform. He and two women went to help the young man, 20-year-old Cameron Hollopeter, but Mr. Hollopeter stumbled while he was getting up and fell onto the tracks.

He and two women went to help the young man, 20-year-old Cameron Hollopeter, but Mr. Hollopeter stumbled while he was getting up and fell onto the tracks.
As a No. 1 train approached, Mr. Autrey jumped down onto the tracks and lay on top of Mr. Hollopeter, pushing into a space that was about a foot deep. Five cars traveled over the two men before the train screeched to a halt. It passed just inches above Mr. Autrey's head, leaving grease on his knit cap.
Mr. Autrey's instinctive willingness to put his life on the line is not something most people would expect to encounter in New York City. But then, the negative stereotypes about New York have never stood up to the facts. Uncharitable? New York ranks first in a newly released state-by-state study of giving by the Boston College Center on Wealth and Philanthropy. Less committed than the rest of the country to the nation's defense? New York City has lost more of its residents in battle in Iraq than the average state.
Not willing to come to the aid of strangers? Mr. Autrey put that one to rest in dramatic fashion. Small-town values are certainly an important part of what makes America great, but so are big-city values, which in many cases are exactly the same.

Re ''The Bankrupt-Your-Family Calling Plan'' (editorial, Dec. 22):
In callously gouging some of New York City's poorest, most vulnerable families, New York State's Department of Correctional Services has shown itself better suited to promoting extortion than curbing recidivism in the collect-call-only system that prisoners must use to call their homes.
Communication is vital in addressing the feelings of separation and abandonment experienced by the children of prison inmates. Regular visits to a far-off prison are beyond the means of inmates' families. The state nonetheless forces them to pay 630 percent more than the average consumer to talk over the phone with imprisoned loved ones.
As I pointed out in a brief challenging the state system, this leaves the children of inmates at greater risk for aggressive behavior and criminal involvement. The positive influence of phone communication can combat these dangerous trends.
Protecting New Yorkers requires more than bricks and mortar. Common sense and decency are also needed.

Re ''Chaos Overran Iraq Plan in '06, Bush Team Says'' (front page, Jan. 2):
It is galling and condescending that President Bush keeps talking about victory in Iraq. ''It's a word the American people understand,'' he told members of the Iraq Study Group. ''And if I start to change it, it will look like I'm beginning to change my policy.''
Americans also understand the word ''failure,'' and having seen it in Iraq, voted resoundingly for a change in policy in November.

Sure, some of Gov. Eliot Spitzer's calls in his first address to the Legislature on Wednesday -- for spending less money, ending gerrymandering and limiting campaign donations -- were met with the kind of icy reception he might have received if he had worn a Red Sox cap to Yankee Stadium.
But Mr. Spitzer, the new governor, also generously sprinkled his State of the State address with proposals that were clearly tailored to meet the needs and sensitivities of his politically divided audience, which will in large part determine his success or failure.

Sure, some of Gov. Eliot Spitzer's calls in his first address to the Legislature on Wednesday -- for spending less money, ending gerrymandering and limiting campaign donations -- were met with the kind of icy reception he might have received if he had worn a Red Sox cap to Yankee Stadium.
But Mr. Spitzer, the new governor, also generously sprinkled his State of the State address with proposals that were clearly tailored to meet the needs and sensitivities of his politically divided audience, which will in large part determine his success or failure.
Mr. Spitzer, a Democrat, took pains to call for some proposals that are favored by the Democratic-led Assembly and others sought by the Republican-led State Senate in the hopes that by offering something to everyone, he would be able to push his agenda through both houses.
''All New Yorkers ask is that when we address these problems, we reject the interest-group politics of division and fear,'' Mr. Spitzer said, ''and compromise enough to find consensus and listen enough to find solutions.''
Mr. Spitzer explicitly linked some proposals, like his call for more education spending, which Democrats cheered, with his call for a $6 billion property tax cut over three years, which brought Republican senators to their feet for an ovation. ''Because of the different needs of our state, as we provide more resources to school districts, we must provide more property tax relief to overtaxed homeowners,'' he said.
His education proposals offered something to each house as well: Mr. Spitzer called for making prekindergarten available to every 4-year-old in the state, long one of the Assembly's top priorities, by the end of his first term and for lifting the cap on charter schools, which the Senate tried to do last year. But his call for a ''new, transparent school funding formula'' was met with uneasy murmurs from some Republican senators, who jealously protect the current formula, which favors suburban districts.
Democrats applauded Mr. Spitzer's calls to insure the 500,000 children who lack health insurance, enroll the 900,000 adults who are eligible for Medicaid but not currently enrolled in it, and issue debt to pay for stem cell research. Republicans applauded his calls to make workers' compensation more affordable for businesses and to overhaul the Wicks Law, which requires school districts and others to hire at least four contractors for big construction jobs, a rule that many school officials say drives up building costs.
Of course, in Albany, linking unrelated issues to one another is nothing new; many a legislative session has ended with negotiations on a raft of measures that get wrapped up in one huge deal, hatched behind closed doors, that is often referred to in the halls of the Capitol as a Big Ugly. And the danger of all-or-nothing negotiations in Albany is that nothing often winds up winning the day.
But the leaders of the Legislature, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, seemed determined on Wednesday to give the new governor a break, in the form of some kind words.
Mr. Silver, who in recent years had taken to lamenting what he called the ''wrong choices'' in Gov. George E. Pataki's addresses, found himself in the unusual position of praising a governor's speech -- effusively. Where he might once have expressed skepticism about a State of the State address that promised to increase education spending and insure the uninsured without raising taxes, Mr. Silver was all praise on Wednesday.
''To the extent that all of the issues he outlined are resolvable by consensus, by taking all of the different views, and putting them together, there was very little I can disagree with,'' Mr. Silver said.
Mr. Silver even praised the way Mr. Spitzer had proposed some items that the Assembly had blocked in the past. Mr. Silver said, for instance, that he was glad that the governor had called for reforming the Wicks Law instead of repealing it. He also said that he was pleased that the governor's proposal to add more charter schools included a pledge for more aid to the school districts that would lose money if their students chose charter schools.
And Senate Republicans were upbeat. Mr. Bruno said that there were enough measures laid out in the speech to please members of both houses -- even if each house might have to go along with some items it dislikes to get what it wants.
''There are things to get things done that you have to kind of swallow hard on, but that's the business we're in,'' Mr. Bruno said. ''Now, what gridlock has been created in the past is because people were not willing to come together, openly, in a creative and imaginative way and compromise.''
Toughest, of course, will be the measures that touch lawmakers directly: the reform agenda. Asked about Mr. Spitzer's call for the full public financing of campaigns, Mr. Bruno said that he would support it for statewide positions but not for state lawmakers. And asked about the governor's call to end gerrymandering, Mr. Silver said only that the Assembly supported changing the current system, but did not say how.
Mr. Spitzer, who may have antagonized his somewhat subdued audience with his early references to Albany's problems and his proposals for change, seemed aware of the difficulty. When his call for the Legislature to analyze and report the fiscal impact of its budget amendments was met with stony silence, he teased the crowd a little.
''You applaud for eliminating gerrymandering, but not for that?'' he asked.

The White House declined Wednesday to criticize the conduct of the execution of Saddam Hussein, even as State Department officials and military leaders in Baghdad raised questions about the timing of the hanging and the way the condemned dictator was taunted by Shiite guards as he stood on the gallows.
Spokesmen for President Bush said he had not seen the video of the execution Saturday, and Mr. Bush himself refused to answer questions about it. Appearing in the Rose Garden with his cabinet to talk about a balanced budget, the president turned his back and walked away when a reporter called out to ask whether he believed that the hanging had been handled appropriately.

The White House declined Wednesday to criticize the conduct of the execution of Saddam Hussein, even as State Department officials and military leaders in Baghdad raised questions about the timing of the hanging and the way the condemned dictator was taunted by Shiite guards as he stood on the gallows.
Spokesmen for President Bush said he had not seen the video of the execution Saturday, and Mr. Bush himself refused to answer questions about it. Appearing in the Rose Garden with his cabinet to talk about a balanced budget, the president turned his back and walked away when a reporter called out to ask whether he believed that the hanging had been handled appropriately.
The circumstances surrounding the hanging have prompted public demonstrations among Mr. Hussein's Sunni loyalists in Iraq and outrage around the world. Yet, while Bush administration officials said in quiet background conversations that they agreed that the execution was bungled, the White House insisted in public on Wednesday that the president was concentrating on the future of Iraq and that he was content to leave the investigation to the Iraqis.
''The most important thing to keep in mind is, this is a guy who killed hundreds of thousands of people and received justice,'' said Tony Snow, the White House press secretary. Mr. Snow said too much attention had been paid to ''the last two minutes'' of Mr. Hussein's life and not enough to the previous 69 years.
With Mr. Bush set to make a major speech, possibly as soon as next week, outlining a new strategy in Iraq, the handling of the execution has put the White House in a difficult position. The president in November proclaimed Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki ''the right guy for Iraq.'' Now Mr. Maliki faces international criticism for his decision to press ahead with the hanging, and questions about whether he is as committed as Mr. Bush to reconciling sectarian differences in Iraq.
The execution was carried out at the onset of a major Islamic festival that began on Saturday for Sunnis and on Sunday for Shiites. Mr. Hussein was subjected to mockery and cries of ''Moktada!'' -- a reference to Moktada al-Sadr, the Shiite cleric whose militia has been responsible for attacks against Sunnis.
''It really was disappointing to see that they didn't have better control over the execution, so that you wouldn't have had that scene, with the demonstration from Moktada's supporters,'' said a senior administration official in Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity, to avoid the appearance of interfering in Iraq's sovereign affairs.
But another official said that the White House had decided the execution did not ''rise to the level of a presidential comment'' and that it was best to let other parts of the administration do the talking.
In Baghdad, Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, the top American military spokesman, conceded that the United States would have handled the execution differently, but said that the final decisions were up to the Iraqi government.
The State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, said that American officials had raised questions last week about the timing of the hanging, but that the execution had been warranted as the result of what he called a ''very solid'' judicial proceeding. He acknowledged that television images of Mr. Hussein being taunted at the gallows could further inflame tensions. ''This happened,'' he said. ''It wasn't supposed to have happened, but it happened.''

The dictator sat alone in his cell, three years in American custody. His beard had gone gray, his sons were dead and the gallows were being readied.
Saddam Hussein in those final days turned to poetry, so often his source of solace in times of difficulty, inspired by his vision of himself as inseparably tied to those he led.
Verses written by Saddam Hussein after he was sentenced to death are his last written words, his relatives said.
The dictator sat alone in his cell, three years in American custody. His beard had gone gray, his sons were dead and the gallows were being readied.
Saddam Hussein in those final days turned to poetry, so often his source of solace in times of difficulty, inspired by his vision of himself as inseparably tied to those he led.
The poem, ''Unbind It,'' is his rallying call to be sounded from the grave.
It is a mixture of defiance and reflection, but no remorse. No mention of the tens of thousands of lives he was responsible for taking. No expression of guilt or sadness or regret.
The poem, flush with florid phrases that were his trademark, begins with what sounds like a paean to the love between himself and his people, who were about to lose him.
Unbind your soul. It is my soul mate and you are my soul's beloved.
No house could have sheltered my heart as you have.
He moves quickly to more aggressive language. He refers to the foreigners who swept him from power and to the Iraqis who rose to rule here in his place.
The enemies forced strangers into our sea
And he who serves them will be made to weep.
Here we unveil our chests to the wolves
And will not tremble before the beast.
The verses were written by Mr. Hussein after he was sentenced to death and, according to his relatives, are believed to be his last written words.
A handwritten copy of the poem was passed along by the Iraqi authorities to his family in Tikrit, along with his final will and testament, according to Mr. Hussein's cousin Muayed Dhamin al-Hazza.
Mr. Hazza read the poem on the telephone, saying he hoped Mr. Hussein's farewell would underline the manner in which the execution was carried out.
Iraqi and American officials confirmed that a poem left among Mr. Hussein's belongings at the American military detention center was delivered to his family.
In the poem, Mr. Hussein praises those who continue to fight for the Iraqi nation and condemns the ''wolves'' who have brought ruin through their invasion. He portrays himself as a martyr.
His poetry, like his speeches at decisive moments of his dictatorship, was often obscure, highly alliterative and difficult, even for Arabic speakers, to comprehend fully.
At the height of his power, Iraqis brave enough to discuss the subject would shake their heads at his rambling speeches and convoluted verse. Some would suggest, with glances over their shoulders, that in his efforts to show himself as a scholar of Arab history and literature, he inadvertently revealed some of the darker recesses of his mind.
According to news reports, Mr. Hussein even made gifts of his poetry to his American captors.
Iraqis familiar with his style helped translate his death cell poem. Sections that would have been unintelligible in a literal translation have been interpreted loosely in an attempt to reveal the meaning Mr. Hussein intended.
He is most clear when talking about how he sees himself in light of his impending death.
I sacrifice my soul for you and for our nation
Blood is cheap in hard times.
Mr. Hussein told his official biographer that he cared little what people thought of him when he was alive, but that he hoped to be revered as one of the giants of history -- as a Nebuchadnezzar or Saladin -- 500 years from now.
He ordered that one in every 10 bricks used in reconstructing the ancient palace at Babylon be stamped with his name or an eight-pointed star to symbolize the eight letters in his name in the Arabic alphabet.
For a man whose vanity was in proportion to his brutality, he appears, from the poem, to have seen himself as dying for a greater good. It was a theme he returned to repeatedly in the courtroom where he was condemned to death for crimes against humanity, telling the judges that he was speaking to history.
Many Iraqis viewed the thousands of portraits of Mr. Hussein erected around the country -- in business suits, as warrior, as Arab sheik -- as a sort of guidebook to his illusions about himself. Even as his secret police murdered tens of thousands, he sealed himself off with the conviction that he was widely loved.
One of his favorite books was ''The Old Man and the Sea,'' but his style could not be mistaken for Hemingway. No short crisp sentences for Mr. Hussein.
While still in power, he wrote, at least in part, two romantic novels. ''Zabibah and the King,'' which is set in a fanciful Arabia of long ago, tells of a lonely king who, while powerful, feels cut off from his liegemen. He encounters Zabibah and is entranced by her beauty and wisdom. But outsiders soon invade the kingdom, which is described as the cradle of civilization, and Zabibah is raped -- on Jan. 17, a reference to the beginning of the Persian Gulf war of 1991.
When the book was released, Central Intelligence Agency analysts reportedly pored over it searching for clues into Mr. Hussein's mind.
But they could just as easily have turned to ''The Old Man and the Sea,'' which Mr. Hussein had first read as a young man in a different prison: ''A man can be destroyed not defeated.''
In that spirit, he urges his followers to be fierce and noble, saying:
We never kneel or bend when attacking
But we even treat our enemy with honor.

The Maplewood Township Committee is asking the public library's board of trustees not to follow through with a plan to close its two buildings during after-school hours and is considering providing security guards to help quell disruptive behavior, Mayor Fred R. Profeta Jr. said Wednesday.
The trustees voted last month to close Maplewood Memorial Library weekdays from 2:45 to 5 p.m., citing an influx of students from the nearby middle school, some of whom have been disruptive.
The Maplewood Township Committee says it will provide security guards in a bid to keep the Maplewood Memorial Library from closing during after-school hours.
The Maplewood Township Committee is asking the public library's board of trustees not to follow through with a plan to close its two buildings during after-school hours and is considering providing security guards to help quell disruptive behavior, Mayor Fred R. Profeta Jr. said Wednesday.
The trustees voted last month to close Maplewood Memorial Library weekdays from 2:45 to 5 p.m., citing an influx of students from the nearby middle school, some of whom have been disruptive.
The committee discussed a plan late Tuesday night to provide the library with security guards.
''The township will pay for that, because it's a public safety issue, though it may go through the library budget,'' Mr. Profeta said in an interview.
Police Chief Robert Cimino said that the department was checking references for several security companies, and that guards could be hired within the next month, at a cost of $280 to $700 a week per guard. Plans call for two guards, he said.
The mayor said he would petition the library board to rescind its initial decision before the planned closing on Jan. 16.
''I think the closure's a very bad idea,'' the mayor said. ''I think that it was not warranted, because a lot of the programs we have in the works are designed -- and well designed -- to alleviate the situation. We just have to put those in place.''
But David Huemer, who represents the Maplewood Township Committee on the library board, said the library had already indicated that a plan for guards was not enough to rescind its vote on the closing.
The council is also considering an expansion of a youth program at the Morrow Memorial United Methodist Church, which now operates on Wednesdays. The mayor said $10,000 in private money could be readily used for the expansion, but did not identify its source.
One middle school program is run in the library basement by the recreation committees of Maplewood and South Orange, and the local Y.M.C.A. provides after-school activities every day for $145 a month, but only 29 of its 51 available spots are filled.
''It's very difficult to monitor 700-plus students once they leave our building,'' said Kristopher Harrison, the principal of Maplewood Middle School, adding that he hoped for an alternative soon. ''Then we could use this disappointing situation and make something very positive for the students,'' he said.

Gov. Eliot Spitzer proposed overhauling almost every corner of the state's operations and policies in his first address to the Legislature on Wednesday. He said he would move swiftly to guarantee health insurance for all children in the state, toughen campaign finance laws, cut property taxes by $6 billion and draft constitutional amendments to overhaul the state's courts.
The dizzying collection of ambitious proposals reflects how the new governor is moving quickly to capitalize on the momentum of his landslide victory and recent government corruption scandals to push through major initiatives early in his term.

Gov. Eliot Spitzer proposed overhauling almost every corner of the state's operations and policies in his first address to the Legislature on Wednesday. He said he would move swiftly to guarantee health insurance for all children in the state, toughen campaign finance laws, cut property taxes by $6 billion and draft constitutional amendments to overhaul the state's courts.
The dizzying collection of ambitious proposals reflects how the new governor is moving quickly to capitalize on the momentum of his landslide victory and recent government corruption scandals to push through major initiatives early in his term. While some of the proposals were outlined during his campaign, in his speech to lawmakers he offered several new initiatives and promised to accomplish others during his first year in office.
''Make no mistake, the changes I just described will not be easy, but change rarely is,'' he said near the end of the speech, in which he used the words ''reform'' or ''reforms'' 31 times. ''At every major transition point in our history, we have experienced uncertainty and growing pains. We will experience them again.''
In an hourlong address that was largely a repudiation of the policies of his predecessor, George E. Pataki, the new governor said he would seek to broadly overhaul the state's ethics and lobbying rules. He said he would make prekindergarten available to all 4-year-olds by the end of his term, overhaul the public authorities that control most of the state's debt and make New York more inviting to business by reducing the cost of workers' compensation.
The speech came two days after his inaugural address, in which he laid out the broad themes of his administration. Wednesday's speech, by contrast, included the outlines of the specific proposals that he hopes to accomplish in the year ahead and in his first term, as he appealed directly to lawmakers.
During the speech, lawmakers responded with varying degrees of applause, cheers and silence as the list of proposals ticked past -- with Mr. Spitzer once jokingly encouraging them to show more enthusiasm.
The two legislative leaders who have ruled the state for the last decade alongside Mr. Pataki generally embraced the speech afterward.
''This is our agenda,'' said the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, the state's top Republican. ''Tax cuts, no new taxes, job creation, education, health care for everyone, reform.''
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, long used to being Mr. Pataki's Democratic foil, responded with relief.
''For the last 12 years, we have witnessed what happens when the two-party system becomes the too-petty system,'' Mr. Silver said, adding that there was ''very little I can disagree with'' in the governor's speech.
But there is no shortage of questions, including how Mr. Spitzer will find the money for all his proposals -- an elixir of promises to decrease spending growth over all but, at the same time, spend billions more on school aid and to insure the state's roughly half a million uninsured children while also providing $6 billion in additional property tax relief over the next three years.
Mr. Spitzer's plan to rein in health care spending, the largest part of the budget, is politically risky; it is likely to alienate the state's powerful health care unions and lobbyists. Among his proposals are broad changes in the state's Medicaid and health care policies, including carrying out a plan, formulated last year, to reduce the hospitals in the state by about 20. He would also shift ''spending away from expensive institutional nursing homes toward community and home-based alternatives.''
He pledged to bring transparency to the state's inscrutable formula for doling out school aid, and he said revitalizing the economy of upstate New York would be a top priority. He called the rebuilding effort at ground zero ''a monument to government gridlock'' and said he would move swiftly to reassess the program. He said he would propose legislation to create a nonpartisan redistricting commission and veto ''any proposal that reflects partisan gerrymandering.'' And he said he would seek to eventually have campaigns for state office publicly financed.
Mr. Spitzer's proposals are at the mercy of lawmakers who benefit from the current system, which practically guarantees them re-election. But the new governor may capitalize on cries for reform in a capital spurred by the investigation, indictment or conviction of at least 10 state lawmakers in recent years.
And just as Mr. Pataki was able to push through tax cuts and the death penalty in his first year in office, lawmakers may be inclined to support many of the Spitzer proposals given his huge election victory.
But some proposals would face other formidable obstacles. In his pledge to address longstanding problems with the state court system, his remedies would require amending the State Constitution, a process that involves approval in two consecutive legislative sessions and then direct ratification by voters.
He said he would submit two constitutional amendments, one of which would tackle the state's court system, which has been described as one of the most complex in the country. In New York, criminal cases are handled by a variety of courts, while lawsuits against the state have a special court of their own. Divorces are heard in the state's Supreme Courts, which are the highest trial courts, but child custody and support cases are often heard in Family Court.
The second constitutional amendment would allow for the appointment of judges based on merit, which Mr. Spitzer said ''will take the politics out of the selection of judges.'' Most judges in the state are now elected, a process that critics say has been tarnished by a spate of scandals involving unqualified or politically connected judges.
His ethics reforms echoed pledges made during the campaign, but they have been given more immediacy by the recent spate of scandals. He said he would move within weeks to introduce ''a reform package to replace the weakest campaign finance laws in the nation with the strongest.''
The package will include drastically lowering campaign contribution limits, closing loopholes that allow individuals to evade those limits easily, and to ''sharply reduce contributions from lobbyists and companies that do business with the state.''
After ethics, he said ''our second major challenge'' would be ''the revitalization of our economy in a rapidly changing world,'' and he gave particular emphasis to reviving the battered economy of upstate New York.
That was endorsed even by New York's mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg. ''His focus in particular on helping upstate -- where we have had population declines and where education has been falling behind the curve and the economy has been slow or even worse -- that's exactly what this state needs,'' Mr. Bloomberg said after the speech. ''And Eliot Spitzer's going to do a great job.''
Mr. Spitzer also called for using new state debt to support research into stem cells and other advanced sciences, a proposal that could be resisted in the Republican-led Senate.
Among his transportation initiatives, he called for expediting a new Peace Bridge, which connects western New York and Canada over the Niagara River at Buffalo. Downstate, he called for building the ''first segment of the Second Avenue subway'' and planning ''for the full extension to Lower Manhattan.'' He also called for finishing the plan to replace the Tappan Zee Bridge and enlarge Stewart Airport in the Hudson Valley ''to become the fourth major airport'' downstate.
Much of the fine print of the governor's proposals will have to wait until the end of the month, when Mr. Spitzer unveils his first executive budget. But even members of his own party are preparing for upheaval.
''Some of the things are tough, but as I told my colleagues, it's been pretty easy around here,'' said the Senate minority leader, Malcolm A. Smith, a Queens Democrat. ''Now you have to step up, and you're going to have to buckle down a little bit, and do the work that the people voted you to be doing.''

In an article published on a friendly op-ed page, and from the regal confines of the White House, President Bush greeted the incoming Democratic leadership of Congress on Wednesday with a message of bipartisanship.
But he also sent another message: I'm still the guy with the big plane, the big office (the oval one) and the presidential seal.
With an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal and an appearance in the Rose Garden, President Bush sought to set the governing agenda.
In an article published on a friendly op-ed page, and from the regal confines of the White House, President Bush greeted the incoming Democratic leadership of Congress on Wednesday with a message of bipartisanship.
But he also sent another message: I'm still the guy with the big plane, the big office (the oval one) and the presidential seal.
With the op-ed, in The Wall Street Journal, and in the Rose Garden appearance, Mr. Bush sought to set the governing agenda one day before Democrats were officially to take control of Congress and alter the balance of power that has favored Mr. Bush's party for nearly his entire presidency.
In doing so, Mr. Bush mixed calls for unity in governing with a series of red flags on his signature issues.
Tax increases? Forget it.
''The elections have not reversed the laws of economics,'' Mr. Bush wrote in The Journal. ''It is a fact that economies do best when you reward hard work by allowing people to keep more of what they have earned.''
The war in Iraq? ''We now have the opportunity to build a bipartisan consensus to fight and win the war,'' he wrote. In other words, we're staying.
That new Democratic majority? It isn't really so big.
''The minority party, especially where the margins are close,'' Mr. Bush wrote, ''has a strong say in the form bills take.'' And the president, he added -- lest anyone forget -- has the constitutional authority ''to use his judgment whether they should be signed into law.''
Several Democrats said Mr. Bush's words on Wednesday had raised questions about what kind of president would show up when they get down to the business of governing side by side.
Some Democrats may have hoped it would be the George W. Bush who contritely acknowledged a ''thumpin' '' for his party the day after the elections in November. But the evidence suggests it is more likely to be the man who all but ignored the disputed circumstances of his election in 2000, governed from then as if he had an expansive mandate and who -- even as he has employed soothing tones in speaking to and about Democrats for the last two months -- has gradually but firmly reasserted himself on both foreign and domestic policy.
''I think what the op-ed showed was the fundamental division within the White House and probably within the president's head whether to stick to the old issues and just talk bipartisanship versus really doing it,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the new vice chairman of the Democratic caucus in the Senate, in an interview.
The first few weeks of January are traditionally when the White House carefully rolls out new or repackaged policy initiatives before the president's State of the Union address, a period when he can set the agenda. But for the first time since early 2002, when Democrats controlled the Senate, Mr. Bush has to share power and the national microphone. He also has to show that he has a domestic agenda at a time when his presidency is largely consumed by Iraq.
Both sides were making some effort on Wednesday to play nice. White House officials noted that the president had highlighted several areas in which he has shown a willingness to work more closely with Democrats, like on a new minimum wage and a new immigration law.
And the White House arranged for a plane to bring the incoming Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, and Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, back to Washington from Gerald R. Ford's funeral in Grand Rapids, Mich., in time for a reception with Mr. Bush and the other Congressional leaders.
In a memorandum that Mr. Reid issued Wednesday to fellow Democrats, he wrote, ''I'm encouraged that President Bush said today that he wants to work in bipartisanship.''
But, he added, ''I hope he means it.'' And in defining his own approach to bipartisanship, Mr. Reid went on to praise Senator Gordon H. Smith, Republican of Oregon, saying Mr. Smith's commentary last month on the administration's war policy -- in which Mr. Smith said it ''may even be criminal'' -- had ''signaled a sea change over how Congress will address the Iraq war.''
Mr. Reid promised to work with Republicans to ''bring oversight and accountability to the Bush administration's conduct of the war and ensure a new policy that meets conditions on the ground'' but also ''allows our troops to come home.''
Democrats were moving quickly to hold the administration accountable, in their view, for its mistakes, promising to hold as many as a dozen oversight hearings on the war alone in the next few weeks.
In interviews, White House officials did not hesitate to acknowledge that they were taking advantage of the last day before the Democrats take control to assert some presidential power.
Nor did they dispute Democrats' suspicions that the White House placed Mr. Bush's opinion piece in The Journal to reassure a target audience of nervous fiscal conservatives -- and the financial markets -- that he remained philosophically opposed to any tax increases.
But administration officials disputed Democratic assertions that the president was trying to upstage them before their big day.
''It's an appropriate time to say where we are on these things and to again reiterate the president's view that we can work together to find common ground,'' said Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman. ''It also doesn't mean that a Democrat-controlled Congress passes whatever they want and we sign it -- that's not bipartisanship.''
But it was clear that as both sides spoke about bipartisanship, they were defining it on different terms.
Mr. Fratto acknowledged as much, saying, ''We'll have to see as we go forward over the next six months, in particular, if everyone has the same understanding of what bipartisanship means.''

The Detroit auto show, which opens next week, is all about new concepts, building buzz and making fresh starts. And the Detroit auto companies can use all of that.
In a stern reminder of how hard it has become to sell cars, General Motors, the Ford Motor and the Chrysler Group ended 2006 with two lows, the companies said Wednesday. Their dismal December performance led to their lowest collective market share ever, just 51.5 percent for the month.
G.M., Ford and Chrysler ended 2006 with a new low in their collective market share  just 51.5 percent for December.
The Detroit auto show, which opens next week, is all about new concepts, building buzz and making fresh starts. And the Detroit auto companies can use all of that.
In a stern reminder of how hard it has become to sell cars, General Motors, the Ford Motor and the Chrysler Group ended 2006 with two lows, the companies said Wednesday. Their dismal December performance led to their lowest collective market share ever, just 51.5 percent for the month.
And for the year, they held only 53.7 percent of the market, also a low. The reason for the poor showing rests mostly with a lineup laden with sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that proved out of fashion with Americans' demand for fuel-sipping automobiles.
''Basically, that caught Detroit by surprise,'' said Ron Pinelli, president of Autodata, which tracks industry statistics.
So did the strength of Toyota Motor of Japan, which set a sales record in 2006 to pass DaimlerChrysler and take third place in the American car market. Now it is bearing down on Ford, which it is expected to unseat this year to take second place, behind G.M.
Wednesday's sales report proves that despite the gleaming new models that are set to go on display at the Cobo Center in Detroit this weekend, the competition on the streets will be just as fierce next year, even though gasoline prices are easing.
At best, analysts and auto executives expect industry sales to be flat with the 16.5 million sold in 2006, down from 16.9 million sold in 2005, according to Autodata.
At worst, some forecasters see sales falling as low as 16 million vehicles, which could force the Detroit companies to speed or expand their revamping plans. ''How do you make profits with less sales?'' said Jesse Toprak, an industry analyst with Edmunds.com, which offers car-buying advice.
No matter the outcome, one thing seems certain: cars are back, big time.
Toyota, whose sales rose 12.9 percent last year, gained more than two percentage points to end the year with 15.4 percent of American sales. It sold almost 450,000 Camry sedans, the nation's best-selling car for the fifth consecutive year, and nearly 400,000 small Corollas.
''We're a company that continues to listen to the market,'' said James Lentz, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A.
A bonus for Toyota was its Scion brands, three small vehicles aimed at the industry's youngest buyers. That division racked up almost as many sales last year as Ford did for its Mercury division.
Honda Motor, meanwhile, said its sales rose 3.5 percent in 2006 to its 10th consecutive record, mostly because of a strong reception for its small car, the Fit. Together, Toyota and Honda sold almost as many cars and trucks in the United States as G.M., where 2006 sales dropped 8.7 percent.
Even Ford, whose overall sales fell 7.9 percent in 2006, could point to its cars as a glimmer of hope. It scored a modest-selling hit in the last year with the midsize Fusion, and it is showing a four-door version of the Mustang at the Detroit show, hoping to build on its pony car's success.
But Ford's efforts on cars cannot camouflage its slumping truck lineup. Sales of its Explorer S.U.V., once the star of its stable of sport utilities, fell 25.3 percent in 2006, while its F-series pickup dropped 11.7 percent. All told, it sold 105,000 fewer of those vehicles than it did in 2005.
Ford will not overhaul the F-series for more than a year, although it plans a new Super Duty model this winter.
By contrast, G.M. has begun selling new models of its pickup, and Toyota will begin selling the biggest version yet of its Tundra next month.
''I think the full-size truck market is going to look very much like a sumo wrestling match,'' said Ford's senior sales analyst, George C. Pipas. ''There is going to be pushing and shoving,''
Paul Ballew, G.M.'s executive director of global market and industry analysis, said the company expected its sales of pickups to remain flat this year.
''I know it's been in vogue this year to talk about the sun setting on the truck business; we obviously disagree with that,'' Mr. Ballew said. ''We don't see the market shrinking, and we see our performance as more than holding our own.''
G.M. did not hold its own in December. Its sales fell 8.7 percent, more than analysts had anticipated given a year-end rebate effort, while its market share for the month was 23.5 percent, compared with an average for the year of 24.3 percent. By contrast, G.M. ended 2005 with 26 percent of the American market.
In the last few months, G.M. executives maintained that the company's market share decline had bottomed out, which helped it fend off pressure from the billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian, who had been its biggest individual shareholder before unloading much of his 9.9 percent stake.
But lately, some analysts have voiced concern that G.M.'s lineup lacks compelling vehicles beyond its pickups, which it expects will sell strongly.
''We believe that a more radical and aggressive approach will need to be taken to turn the company around, most specifically in North America,'' John Murphy, a Merrill Lynch analyst, said in a research note on Wednesday, repeating his sell rating on G.M. stock.
There is also concern in the industry over Chrysler, which offered generous rebates during December to clear out backlogs on dealer lots, especially of leftover 2006 models. Its sales rose 1 percent, though December sales for DaimlerChrysler, including Mercedes, fell 1 percent. For the year, Chrysler sales fell 6.7 percent. Yesterday, the company announced a new wave of incentives of up to $5,000 on some new models.
Mr. Pinelli said the dismal end to a dismal year was a warning to American auto makers that analysts said was long overdue.
''Detroit gets it now,'' he said. ''They realize that the market-share battle and survival are going to be based on product as well as an image that needs to be revitalized.''

A laboratory that has tested most of the nation's electronic voting systems has been temporarily barred from approving new machines after federal officials found that it was not following its quality-control procedures and could not document that it was conducting all the required tests.
The company, Ciber Inc. of Greenwood Village, Colo., has also come under fire from analysts hired by New York State over its plans to test new voting machines for the state. New York could eventually spend $200 million to replace its aging lever devices.
Federal officials found that Ciber Inc. could not document that it was conducting all the required tests.
A laboratory that has tested most of the nation's electronic voting systems has been temporarily barred from approving new machines after federal officials found that it was not following its quality-control procedures and could not document that it was conducting all the required tests.
The company, Ciber Inc. of Greenwood Village, Colo., has also come under fire from analysts hired by New York State over its plans to test new voting machines for the state. New York could eventually spend $200 million to replace its aging lever devices.
Experts on voting systems say the Ciber problems underscore longstanding worries about lax inspections in the secretive world of voting-machine testing. The action by the federal Election Assistance Commission seems certain to fan growing concerns about the reliability and security of the devices.
The commission acted last summer, but the problem was not disclosed then. Officials at the commission and Ciber confirmed the action in recent interviews.
Ciber, the largest tester of the nation's voting machine software, says it is fixing its problems and expects to gain certification soon.
Experts say the deficiencies of the laboratory suggest that crucial features like the vote-counting software and security against hacking may not have been thoroughly tested on many machines now in use.
''What's scary is that we've been using systems in elections that Ciber had certified, and this calls into question those systems that they tested,'' said Aviel D. Rubin, a computer science professor at Johns Hopkins.
Professor Rubin said that although some software bugs had shown up quickly, in other instances ''you might have to use the systems for a while before something happens.''
Officials at the commission and other election experts said it was essential for a laboratory to follow its quality-control procedures and document all its testing processes to instill confidence in the results.
Commission officials said that they were evaluating the overall diligence of the laboratory and that they did not try to determine whether its weaknesses had contributed to problems with specific machines.
Computer scientists have shown that some electronic machines now in use are vulnerable to hacking. Some scientists caution that even a simple software error could affect thousands of votes.
In various places, elections have been complicated by machines that did not start, flipped votes from one candidate to another or had trouble tallying the votes.
Until recently, the laboratories that test voting software and hardware have operated without federal scrutiny. Even though Washington and the states have spent billions to install the new technologies, the machine manufacturers have always paid for the tests that assess how well they work, and little has been disclosed about any flaws that were discovered.
As soon as federal officials began a new oversight program in July, they detected the problems with Ciber. The commission held up its application for interim accreditation, thus barring Ciber from approving new voting systems in most states.
Ciber, a large information technology company, also has a $3 million contract to help New York test proposed systems from six manufacturers. Nystec, a consulting firm in Rome, N.Y., that the state hired, filed a report in late September criticizing Ciber for creating a plan to test the software security that ''did not specify any test methods or procedures for the majority of the requirements.'' The report said the plan did not detail how Ciber would look for bugs in the computer code or check hacking defenses.
A spokeswoman for Ciber, Diane C. Stoner, said that the company believed that it had addressed all the problems and that it expected to receive its initial federal accreditation this month. Federal officials said they were evaluating the changes the company had made.
Ms. Stoner said in a statement that although the Election Assistance Commission had found deficiencies, they ''were not because Ciber provided incomplete, inaccurate or flawed testing, but because we did not document to the E.A.C.'s liking all of the testing that we were performing.''
She added that the test plan cited in New York was just a draft and that Ciber had been working with Nystec to ensure additional security testing.
The co-chairman of the New York State Board of Elections, Douglas A. Kellner, said Ciber had tightened its testing. But Mr. Kellner said yesterday that Nystec and Ciber continued to haggle over the scope of the security testing.
New York is one of the last states to upgrade its machines, and it also has created some of the strictest standards for them. Mr. Kellner said only two of the six bidders, Diebold Election Systems and Liberty Election Systems, seemed close to meeting all the requirements.
Besides Ciber, two other companies, SysTest Labs of Denver and Wyle Laboratories, in El Segundo, Calif., test electronic voting machines. Ciber, which has been testing the machines since 1997, checks just software. Wyle examines hardware, and SysTest can look at both.
The chairman of the Election Assistance Commission, Paul S. DeGregorio, said SysTest and Wyle received interim accreditations last summer. Mr. DeGregorio said two other laboratories had also applied to enter the field.
Congress required greater federal oversight when it passed the Help America Vote Act of 2002. Since then, the government also put up more than $3 billion to help states and localities buy electronic machines, to avoid a repeat of the hanging punch-card chads that caused such confusion in the 2000 presidential election.
The commission was never given a substantial budget, and it did not finish creating the oversight program until last month. Until then, the laboratories had been at the heart of the system to evaluate voting machines, a system that seemed oddly cobbled together.
While the federal government created standards for the machines, most of the states enacted laws to make them binding. The states also monitored the testing, and much of that work was left to a handful of current and former state election officials who volunteered their time.
As a result, voting rights advocates and other critics have long been concerned about potential conflicts of interest, because the manufacturers hire the laboratories and largely try to ensure confidentiality.
Michael I. Shamos, a computer scientist who examines voting machines for Pennsylvania, said about half had significant defects that the laboratories should have caught.
Besides certifying the laboratories, the Election Assistance Commission will have three staff members and eight part-time technicians to approve test plans for each system and check the results. The manufacturers will be required to report mechanical breakdowns and botched tallies, and Mr. DeGregorio said those reports would be on the agency's Web site.
Dr. Shamos said, ''This is not the sea change that was needed.''
He said he was disappointed that the commission had hired some of the same people involved in the states' monitoring program and that it never announced it had found problems with Ciber operations.
Dr. Rubin of Johns Hopkins said the laboratories should be required to hire teams of hackers to ferret out software vulnerabilities.
And the laboratories will still be paid by the voting machine companies, though a bill now in Congress could change that to government financing.
A recent appearance in Sarasota, Fla., by the SysTest Labs president, Brian T. Phillips, also raised eyebrows. After a Congressional election in the Sarasota area ended in a recount last month, the victorious Republican candidate hired Mr. Phillips as a consultant to monitor the state's examination of whether there had been a malfunction in the voting machines.
Several critics questioned whether Mr. Phillips should have taken such work, either because of its partisan nature or because it represented such a public defense of the industry.
Mr. Phillips said he did not see any conflict because his laboratory had not tested the software used in Sarasota. And the project does not appear to have violated the ethics rules of the election commission.

Shakespeare's Church Is Crumbling
The church where Shakespeare is buried is ''urgently'' seeking nearly $400,000 for repairs to its tower and spire, Agence France-Presse reported. ''The New Year brings with it a focus on the fund to help solve the immediate crisis of the tower and spire,'' said the fund-raisers, Friends of Shakespeare's Church. The building is the Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-on-Avon, where Shakespeare was baptized, worshiped with his family and was buried in the chancel in 1616. The Friends said, the church, dating to the 13th century, needs as much as $2 million in renovations, including work on the chancel roof, windows and stonework.

Acropolis Museum Dig Unearths Hoard
Excavations for the new Acropolis Museum in Athens have yielded a trove of 50,000 relics, including a nearly perfectly preserved marble bust of Aristotle, The Guardian of London reported. ''Thanks to the new Acropolis Museum, we were able to conduct the biggest ever dig within the walls of Athens's ancient city,'' said Stamatia Eleftheratou, an archaeologist. The finds, amid the ruins of villas, workshops, bathhouses, courtyards and networks of sewers, also include cooking utensils, children's games and figurines of little-known deities. The decision to build the $183 million museum on an archaeologically rich site was criticized, but it allowed for a dig in a densely settled area of ancient Athens. The bust of Aristotle, with an aquiline nose, protruding forehead, floppy hair and minute eyes and mouth, is a Roman copy of a fourth-century B.C. original. Alkestis Choremi, the former director of the Athens department of prehistoric and classical antiquities, said: ''This comes closer to resembling him than anything ever discovered here. It offers a rare depiction of how he looked.''

A Lithuanian court cleared the way for the start yesterday of telecasts of the irreverent cartoon series ''Popetown'' by rejecting a petition by the Lithuanian Bishops' Conference to ban the series as a mockery of the Roman Catholic Church and clergy and an incitement of hatred, according to MTV, Agence France-Presse reported. Ema Segal, a spokeswoman for MTV Lietuva, said the court rejected the request, ''saying it found no evidence to confirm any threat to the church.'' She added, ''We are happy that the court once again confirmed that media in Lithuania are free.'' The ''Popetown'' Web site (popetown.com) says the cartoon takes the viewer into the ''surreal world of the Vatican as the long-suffering and good-hearted Father Nicholas struggles to walk the narrow path of righteousness, whilst surrounded by money grabbing cardinals and a pogo-stick-riding infantile pope.''

The Friends said, the church, dating to the 13th century, needs as much as $2 million in renovations, including work on the chancel roof, windows and stonework.
Fox Cancels 'The O.C.'
''The O.C.,'' the popular teen dramatic series, will run its final episode on Feb. 22, after four years on Fox, the network announced. ''The O.C.'' followed a the lives of a group of teenagers in Newport Beach, a beach town in Orange County, Calif.
Acropolis Museum Dig Unearths Hoard
Excavations for the new Acropolis Museum in Athens have yielded a trove of 50,000 relics, including a nearly perfectly preserved marble bust of Aristotle, The Guardian of London reported. ''Thanks to the new Acropolis Museum, we were able to conduct the biggest ever dig within the walls of Athens's ancient city,'' said Stamatia Eleftheratou, an archaeologist. The finds, amid the ruins of villas, workshops, bathhouses, courtyards and networks of sewers, also include cooking utensils, children's games and figurines of little-known deities. The decision to build the $183 million museum on an archaeologically rich site was criticized, but it allowed for a dig in a densely settled area of ancient Athens. The bust of Aristotle, with an aquiline nose, protruding forehead, floppy hair and minute eyes and mouth, is a Roman copy of a fourth-century B.C. original. Alkestis Choremi, the former director of the Athens department of prehistoric and classical antiquities, said: ''This comes closer to resembling him than anything ever discovered here. It offers a rare depiction of how he looked.''
Nice Work if You Can Get It
George Michael, below, received nearly $3 million for an hour's performance at a New Year's party outside Moscow and was home in London by morning, the BBC reported. Mr. Michael's spokeswoman said the fee, paid by an unidentified Russian billionaire, took Mr. Michael and his entourage by private jet to an estate 20 miles from the Russian capital, where he entertained 300 guests. And though he was reported to have had fun, Mr. Michael left in time to reach home by morning. (Flying time from Moscow to London is three and a half hours.)
Will 'Divine Comedy' Play the Vatican?
Hell and the Vatican will intersect in a new opera adapted from Dante's ''Divine Comedy'' and created by a Vatican composer. Organizers plan to begin rehearsals in a few weeks and have asked permission for the premiere to take place at the Vatican in the presence of Pope Benedict XVI, above right, the BBC reported. The composer, Msgr. Marco Frisina, said the production, including 200 performers and musicians on a huge stage, will vary in musical style. Rock, punk and rave will illustrate hell, and purgatory will be evoked through Gregorian chant; heaven reportedly will be depicted through classical-style melody.
Lithuanian Court Allows 'Popetown' Broadcast
A Lithuanian court cleared the way for the start yesterday of telecasts of the irreverent cartoon series ''Popetown'' by rejecting a petition by the Lithuanian Bishops' Conference to ban the series as a mockery of the Roman Catholic Church and clergy and an incitement of hatred, according to MTV, Agence France-Presse reported. Ema Segal, a spokeswoman for MTV Lietuva, said the court rejected the request, ''saying it found no evidence to confirm any threat to the church.'' She added, ''We are happy that the court once again confirmed that media in Lithuania are free.'' The ''Popetown'' Web site (popetown.com) says the cartoon takes the viewer into the ''surreal world of the Vatican as the long-suffering and good-hearted Father Nicholas struggles to walk the narrow path of righteousness, whilst surrounded by money grabbing cardinals and a pogo-stick-riding infantile pope.''

227 <html><head><b><center>Ethics Overhaul Tops the Agenda as the Democrats Take Over<center></b></head><p align="left">House Democrats introduce proposed ethics rules, saying they will immediately try to cut ties between lawmakers and lobbyists who figured into scandals that helped Democrats win control of Congress; photos (M)
On the brink of regaining power after 12 years, House Democrats said Wednesday that they would move immediately to try to sever ties between lawmakers and lobbyists who figured into scandals that helped Democrats win control of Congress.
Democrats, who campaigned relentlessly last year on the theme of a Republican culture of corruption, introduced the proposed ethics rules as part of a week of choreography designed to deliver the message that they did not intend to do business as usual in Washington. In some cases, like restrictions on the use of corporate jets, the rules on gifts and travel by lobbyists go further than what Democrats had pledged earlier.
House Democrats said that they would move immediately to try to sever ties between lawmakers and lobbyists.
On the brink of regaining power after 12 years, House Democrats said Wednesday that they would move immediately to try to sever ties between lawmakers and lobbyists who figured into scandals that helped Democrats win control of Congress.
Democrats, who campaigned relentlessly last year on the theme of a Republican culture of corruption, introduced the proposed ethics rules as part of a week of choreography designed to deliver the message that they did not intend to do business as usual in Washington. In some cases, like restrictions on the use of corporate jets, the rules on gifts and travel by lobbyists go further than what Democrats had pledged earlier.
Another part of the Democrats' package called for detailed disclosure of pet projects or special-interest tax benefits that individual lawmakers insert into major bills. On Wednesday, President Bush jumped into the debate on such spending projects, called earmarks, urging that their number and cost be cut in half this year, a proposal that Democrats immediately rejected.
The ethics issue continued to reverberate Wednesday, officially the last day of Republican control. Two House Republicans, Representative Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania and Tom Feeney of Florida, agreed to pay for trips that the ethics committee determined had been improperly paid for by outside interests.
Mr. Feeney's case involved a $5,640 trip to Scotland originally paid for by Jack Abramoff, the now-imprisoned lobbyist who was at the center of the Congressional corruption scandals. Mr. Weldon, who was defeated for re-election, will pay $23,000 for an undisclosed trip.
The rules changes would also take aim at the so-called K Street Project, the effort associated with the hardball tactics of the former Republican leader Tom DeLay, to pressure trade groups and lobbying firms to hire Republicans or face the legislative consequences. The proposal would prohibit lawmakers and staff members from trying to exert partisan influence on hiring decisions.
''I think this package is more than a good-faith effort,'' said Meredith McGehee, policy director of the Campaign Legal Center, an ethics group. Referring to the incoming House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, Ms. McGehee said, ''If these rule changes are any indication, she is serious.''
But the ethics rules do not address the most valuable gifts that come from lobbyists and others interested in legislation: campaign donations. And the Democratic Party's fund-raising machine -- revved up by the advantages of being in the majority -- continued apace this week with individual members inviting lobbyists and other contributors to a host of events.
On Thursday night, Mrs. Pelosi is having a $1,000-a-head fund-raiser with performances by Tony Bennett, Carole King, Wyclef Jean and the surviving members of the Grateful Dead. ''Ms. Pelosi is a huge Dead fan,'' her spokeswoman said.
Senator Richard J. Durbin was among those who stopped by a reception Wednesday evening for a fellow Illinois Democrat, Representative Melissa Bean, who won a close and expensive re-election race in November. The reception, at Johnny's Half Shell, a restaurant on Capitol Hill popular with lobbyists and lawmakers, drew lobbyists from both parties.
As they prepared for the pomp and festivities that will mark the Capitol Hill power switch, Democrats got a taste of the potential difficulties of governing with thin majorities in the House and Senate as well as a Republican White House and a presidential election two years off.
While Democrats sought to introduce their ethics legislation at a news conference, the antiwar activist Cindy Sheehan and others interrupted with chants of ''Troops home now; de-escalate, investigate.'' The scene vividly illustrated the pressure that Democrats will face from the left wing of their party to challenge President Bush more aggressively on Iraq. Ms. Sheehan and other antiwar advocates felt they contributed to the Democrats' takeover of Congress.
At the same time, Republicans made clear they intend to hold Democrats accountable for their pledge to allow more minority party participation in legislation. They assailed Democrats' plans to push through major legislation right away without allowing Republican alternatives. Though the Republicans severely limited Democrats' input when they were in charge, they rejected accusations that they were hypocritical.
''The important point here is that the American people were promised a new way of doing business in the United States Congress,'' said Representative Adam H. Putnam of Florida, chairman of the House Republican Conference.
Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the new majority leader, said Republicans would get their chance after Democrats disposed of legislation on national security, minimum wage, prescription drug costs, stem cell research, student loan costs and energy.
''We said to the American people, 'If you elect us, if you put us in charge, this is what we are going to do and we are going to do it in the first 100 hours,' '' Mr. Hoyer told reporters.
Democrats were dogged by technical difficulties when a changeover in House Web sites delayed the formal posting of their ethics proposal.
The Senate will convene Thursday as well, with Democrats and Republicans meeting first in an unofficial closed-door session in the old Senate chambers to try to find some common ground. Aides said the Senate was going to take up its own ethics package next week, allowing a week or more of floor debate to shape legislation.
Besides the rules barring lawmakers from accepting gifts, meals or trips from lobbyists or the organizations that employ them, the House Democratic plan would also require preapproval from the Ethics Committee for any trips paid for by other outside groups aside from educational institutions.
On the subject of corporate jets, Democrats had previously discussed raising the rate at which lawmakers reimburse corporations or other sponsors for flights, but still allowing use of the jets. But the rules proposed Wednesday would bar lawmakers from any use of corporate jets.
Previous Democratic and Republican proposals about shedding light on earmarks, the pet projects lawmakers insert into major spending bills, left large loopholes, particularly in regard to military contracts.
In contrast, the new rules appear to apply to all spending earmarks as well as tax or tariff provisions that benefit fewer than 10 companies or people. They would also require disclosure of such items in each bill as well as the individual sponsors.
The rules would further require each House member requesting an earmark or limited tax provision to certify that he or she would not profit from the provision.
Democratic leaders also said that in February they would take up potential new restrictions on members of Congress and staff members becoming lobbyists, and that in March they would consider creating an outside panel to enforce the ethics rules -- a step that lawmakers of both parties have resisted.
President Bush called for the Democrats to adopt even more drastic restrictions on earmarks, a perennial bane to executive branch officials who resent Congressional meddling in their budgets.
''One important message we all should take from the elections is that people want to end the secretive process by which Washington insiders are able to get billions of dollars directed to projects, many of them pork barrel projects that have never been reviewed or voted on by the Congress,'' Mr. Bush said. He called on Democrats to require ''full disclosure'' of ''the costs, the recipients, and the justifications for every earmark'' as well as sponsors.
THE 110TH CONGRESS

There were comparisons to ''Alice in Wonderland,'' ''Star Trek,'' ''The Twilight Zone,'' and all manner of clichés to convey the strangeness engulfing Washington this week as the Democrats prepared to assume control of Congress after 12 years in the minority wilderness. But nothing distilled the new aura of things like this conceit: Steny Hoyer, Rock Star.
''Here he comes, here he comes,'' a member of the press throng effervesced when Mr. Hoyer of Maryland, the incoming House majority leader, strode into the room as if he owned the place. Which, in effect, he does -- at least the larger, plusher office he is inheriting, which used to belong to Tom DeLay, Mr. Hoyer was compelled to point out. (Not that anyone's keeping track.)
A strangeness engulfed Washington this week as the Democrats prepared to assume control of Congress after 12 years in the minority wilderness.
There were comparisons to ''Alice in Wonderland,'' ''Star Trek,'' ''The Twilight Zone,'' and all manner of clichés to convey the strangeness engulfing Washington this week as the Democrats prepared to assume control of Congress after 12 years in the minority wilderness. But nothing distilled the new aura of things like this conceit: Steny Hoyer, Rock Star.
''Here he comes, here he comes,'' a member of the press throng effervesced when Mr. Hoyer of Maryland, the incoming House majority leader, strode into the room as if he owned the place. Which, in effect, he does -- at least the larger, plusher office he is inheriting, which used to belong to Tom DeLay, Mr. Hoyer was compelled to point out. (Not that anyone's keeping track.)
Mr. Hoyer surveyed the conference room and held his arms slightly apart, as if to frame the unusual site before him: a crush of 60 or so reporters, camera operators, TV types and assorted security people, staff members and hangers-on to befit the status of an emerging fuss magnet.
The fussers were present for Mr. Hoyer's ''pen and pad'' briefing, and in considerably greater numbers than during his days in the minority.
''We're going to reserve some seats for those who came to these pen and pads when I was irrelevant,'' Mr. Hoyer said, a line he had deployed before, but which served the recurring purpose of marking the juxtaposition of fortunes that are on full display in the up-is-down realm of Capitol Hill. ''There are some who think I'm still irrelevant,'' he added, not proffering guesses.
Mr. Hoyer wore a shiny white dress shirt, a red power tie and an occasional look of stunned confusion. To his right, movers passed the window, carrying lamps and tables. Mr. Hoyer was hard to decipher at times, speaking in the mumble of someone accustomed to smaller audiences.
'It's Not Whining'
Not so the Republicans convened upstairs. Waving his hands and stomping his feet, Representative Patrick T. McHenry of North Carolina acted out on Wednesday what the rest of the Republican caucus must have felt. ''It is so hypocritical, just on its face,'' Mr. McHenry fumed.
His complaint: That Democrats, on the verge of taking control of Congress, were planning to run the place their way, driving the legislative agenda themselves without input from the Republican minority.
Wasn't that, someone asked, how the Republicans had run Congress for more than a decade?
''We didn't campaign on this openness,'' Mr. McHenry argued, denying that he and his colleagues were just being sore losers. ''It's not whining,'' he said. ''It's a matter of calling them out on their rhetoric.''
Democrats had not even taken over yet. But Republicans, suddenly facing a minimum two-year sentence out of power, coalesced around a message of kvetching.
They held up reports that Democrats would conduct their first 100 hours without allowing Republican amendments. They held news conferences to deplore the new regime, citing letters from Mrs. Pelosi from when she was in the minority, requesting a piece of the legislative action.
''There are lots of messages that came across in this November election, and one of the messages was change in doing things differently,'' said Representative Kay Granger, Republican of Texas.
Watch for Falling Marble
Across town, Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut presided over an afternoon tea that brought together Democratic women for what she described as ''our understated way of saying we've arrived.''
But as with much of the week's festivities, there was nothing understated about whom the celebration was for: a giant photograph of the incoming speaker, Nancy Pelosi, was on a screen at the front of the room, alongside one of Ann Richards, the first woman to be governor of Texas, who died in September.
When Mrs. Pelosi takes the gavel, Ms. DeLauro said, ''The sound you hear will be the glass ceiling in this country, and the marble ceiling in this institution, shattering.''
Drop the Pacifier and Smile
''Who is that guy?'' a staffer asked, pointing to a big-shotty looking man with a small entourage in the Cannon office building. Must be a new member, he concluded.
Nope, it was Paul Pelosi, the new speaker's husband, leading members of the first family of Congress to get ID card photographs.
This included Paul Michael Vos, the 6-week-old grandson of the speaker and Mr. Pelosi and the son of the filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi, whose HBO documentary ''Journeys with George'' chronicled George W. Bush's first presidential campaign.
Paul's birth nearly conflicted with Grandma Pelosi's last-minute campaign plans, but he had the good sense not to go off message and showed up after Election Day.
And yes, newborns require photo ID's on Capitol Hill. His father, Michiel Vos, dutifully carried his son into the room marked ''ID services.'' Fifteen minutes later, he emerged crying (the baby, not the father), but with a shiny new photo ID clipped to his adorable onesie.
Hello, but First, This Protest
Down the hallway, Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois was starting to address another news media mob that had waited for him to emerge from a meeting of the House Democratic Caucus. Mr. Emanuel wished everyone a happy new year, apologized for being late and was promptly drowned out by a group of antiwar protesters, led by the ubiquitous Cindy Sheehan.
''De-escalate, investigate,'' the group chanted. ''Troops home now.''
Mr. Emanuel and Mr. Hoyer decided to leave their podium and return later. ''Looks like we're taking a little break,'' Mr. Hoyer said as he and Mr. Emmanuel rushed away.
Ms. Sheehan was happy to take over the microphone, not to mention the lingering throng of reporters.
She called for a greater role for the peace movement in the Democratic majority, which she said was ignoring the people who put them in power -- the peace movement. She called for an end to financing the war.
''And these are not requests,'' said Ms. Sheehan, whose son Casey was killed in Iraq. ''These are demands.''
Ms. Sheehan vowed to stay around all week.
''It looks like business as usual, and that's why we're here,'' Ms. Sheehan said in a brief interview. ''We want business as unusual.''

Drivers crossing the George Washington Bridge must contend with 18-wheelers, infuriating delays and noxious exhaust. Soon, they will also have advertisements from Geico.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is expected to announce an arrangement with Geico, the auto insurance giant, that will include the posting of a huge billboard on top of the toll plaza in Fort Lee, N.J., that says ''Geico Drive Safely.'' Drivers will also see Geico signs with the company's mascot, a gecko, on the tollbooths and electronic signs on the approach roads.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is to announce a deal with Geico that includes advertising at the George Washington Bridge toll plaza.
Drivers crossing the George Washington Bridge must contend with 18-wheelers, infuriating delays and noxious exhaust. Soon, they will also have advertisements from Geico.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is expected to announce an arrangement with Geico, the auto insurance giant, that will include the posting of a huge billboard on top of the toll plaza in Fort Lee, N.J., that says ''Geico Drive Safely.'' Drivers will also see Geico signs with the company's mascot, a gecko, on the tollbooths and electronic signs on the approach roads.
Geico's message will also be integrated into the Port Authority's direct mailings and its Web site, and costumed gecko mascots will appear at Port Authority bus stations.
The arrangement, first reported in The Wall Street Journal, will provide the agency with $3.2 million over two years. It is the first of its kind for the Port Authority, which has been trying to find new sources of revenue to offset rising costs, said Stephen Sigmund, the agency's chief of public and government affairs.
Geico is not the first company to think about buying a bridge -- or at least the advertising rights to one. And other public agencies have been exploring unconventional ways to bring in more money, even if it means toying with long-held taboos about commercializing public spaces. The Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District, for instance, is exploring how to sell sponsorships in San Francisco.
Mr. Sigmund said the Port Authority had been looking for the right advertisers since at least 2005, adding that Geico was a natural since it is one of the country's largest and best-known auto insurers.
In a world where consumers can fast-forward through television advertisements, subscribe to commercial-free satellite radio and block pop-up ads on the Internet, companies like Geico are continually looking for fresh ways to get in front of consumers.
In that context, getting in front of about 57 million eastbound drivers who cross the George Washington Bridge each year could amount to a gold mine, especially because it is not uncommon for cars to spend 15 or more minutes creeping toward the toll plaza in New Jersey.
''This is more than just eyeballs; it's about reinforcing a message about a bridge that people have an endearing feeling to,'' said Drew Sheinman, chief executive of Axcess Partners Worldwide, a marketing company hired by the Port Authority to develop new advertising.
Mr. Sheinman said that under the agreement, no other signs can compete with Geico's at the bridge, which may allay fears that the toll plaza will become overrun with ads.
''This is not going to be left field at Yankee Stadium,'' he said.
Still, the new signs could irritate drivers who view their cars as a refuge from media messages, as well as preservationists who see the bridge, a landmark, as unfit for commercial advertisements -- even if they appear only on the tollbooths.
''It's a city icon that should not be tampered with in this way,'' said Vanessa Gruen, of the streetscape committee at the Municipal Art Society, which deals with street and sidewalk advertising. ''It's not really worth the amount of money they'll get out of it to block the view of the span.''
Brand experts also questioned whether Geico, which has won plaudits for its imaginative advertising campaigns, may turn off customers and dilute its name by making it too prominent.
''Since advertisers have generally lost some degree of control over what messages get into people's lives, consumers resent getting them foisted on them,'' said Robert Passikoff, the president of Brand Keys, a brand consultant.
But, Mr. Passikoff added, consumers may warm to the Geico ads as well as others on prominent public buildings and bridges if they know the proceeds are being used to improve service.
The Port Authority has set a goal of generating $100 million in advertising and sponsorships, about three times more than it currently brings in, Mr. Sigmund said. He said, though, that the new advertising must match the surroundings and not jeopardize safety.
Last month, for instance, the Port Authority announced an agreement with Samsung, the electronics giant, to install power outlets at Kennedy International Airport that travelers with laptop computers will be able to use.

Gov. Eliot Spitzer vowed yesterday to make health insurance available to all children and enroll all eligible adults in Medicaid. If carried out fully, his pledges would cut the number of uninsured New Yorkers in half.
But those promises may not turn out to be as ambitious as described. How far they go will depend on details the governor and his staff said would not be made public until late this month.
If carried out fully, Gov. Eliot Spitzer’s pledges on health insurance would cut the number of uninsured New Yorkers in half.
Gov. Eliot Spitzer vowed yesterday to make health insurance available to all children and enroll all eligible adults in Medicaid. If carried out fully, his pledges would cut the number of uninsured New Yorkers in half.
But those promises may not turn out to be as ambitious as described. How far they go will depend on details the governor and his staff said would not be made public until late this month.
At their most far-reaching, the governor's plans would give New York the lowest percentage of uninsured people in the country, and would mark a sharp increase in coverage for the poor. Even so, such promises would not be as hard or as expensive to carry out as most people would guess, according to people who study the politics and economics of health care.
People who have no health insurance tend to be young and healthy, cheaper to care for and cheaper to cover than those who are currently covered. As a result, the United Hospital Fund, a policy research group, has estimated that covering all of the uninsured in New York would cost $4.1 billion a year -- less than one-tenth of what the state already spends on Medicaid, the health plan for the poor. Most of the uninsured are also poor, and already qualify for Medicaid or a similar program, Child Health Plus, so experts said that easier enrollment and more aggressive recruitment in those programs would almost certainly be at the center of Mr. Spitzer's plans.
The biggest obstacle, they said, could be new federal requirements that people signing up for Medicaid produce birth certificates or other proof of citizenship.
In his first address to the Legislature, Mr. Spitzer said, ''We will introduce a budget that in the very first year, guarantees access to health insurance for all of New York's 500,000 uninsured children.''
But to guarantee access to insurance and to guarantee actual coverage could be two very different things. Many people have access to government programs, at least in theory, but do not take advantage of them. Again, the governor did not say precisely what he meant by his promise.
In New York, children qualify for free health insurance through either Medicaid or Child Health Plus, in households that earn up to 160 percent of the federal poverty line -- about $21,000 a year for a family of four. Above that limit, up to 250 percent of the poverty line -- about $33,000 for a family of four -- they are eligible for Child Health Plus for a premium of $15 a month or less.
About two-thirds of New York's uninsured children already qualify for one of the programs on those terms. Danielle Holahan, senior health policy analyst at the United Hospital Fund, said, ''That, plus the fact that children are pretty cheap to insure,'' suggests that getting most of them enrolled ''is something we could tackle pretty easily.''
State law also says that any child, no matter how high the family income, can be enrolled in Child Health Plus by paying a premium that averages less than $200 a month, much less than a commercial insurance policy. Officials in the Pataki administration argued that that means New York already guarantees access to coverage for all children.
Ms. Holahan said the state could draw middle-income children into Child Health Plus by putting the premiums on a sliding scale as incomes rise, rather than having an abrupt jump up from $15 a month.
Mr. Spitzer said that within four years, ''we will enroll the 900,000 Medicaid-eligible adults'' by simplifying the paperwork.
That promise could be tougher to keep, experts said, because he is promising not mere access but actual coverage. Each year, about one-third of the people on Medicaid in New York fail to renew their enrollment, though they remain eligible, so policy analysts say that an easier renewal process would keep some people enrolled. They also proposed tying Medicaid enrollment to food stamps, welfare, schools and other public services.
But some people are reluctant to sign up, particularly immigrants who mistrust the government or just cannot be bothered.
''The only way you ever get to really universal coverage is with some sort of individual mandate requiring people to enroll,'' said Diane Rowland, executive director of the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured.
Almost 14 percent of New Yorkers are uninsured, according to the Census Bureau, below the national average of nearly 16 percent but well above Minnesota, with the lowest rate, less than 9 percent. If Mr. Spitzer succeeds in insuring all children and all people eligible for Medicaid, the number of uninsured in New York would drop below 7 percent.
Medicaid spends more than $45 billion a year to insure 4.2 million New Yorkers, but most of those costs are spent on older and disabled patients.
An estimated 1.2 million people qualify for Medicaid or Child Health Plus but are not enrolled. They are disproportionately healthy young adults and children.
''Low-income people who have serious health needs end up in a hospital emergency room, and they enroll in Medicaid at that time, if they're not enrolled already,'' Ms. Rowland said. ''So the remaining uninsured tend to be healthier than those who are insured.''

Wesley Autrey, who jumped on the subway tracks to save a man who had fallen, has been deluged with phones calls from well wishers.
Wesley Autrey teetered back and forth on the edge of a subway platform yesterday, re-enacting how he dived onto the tracks of a southbound No. 1 train in Manhattan on Tuesday to save another man's life.
A little boy with black hair and a bowl cut followed each of his moves. Other passers-by at the 137th Street station let loose the occasional hurrah or hand clap. Still others riffled through newspapers, which featured Mr. Autrey's picture and headlines like ''Subway Superman.''
A few subway stops away, at St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital Center on 114th street near Amsterdam Avenue, Cameron Hollopeter underwent a second day of medical evaluation. Police said Mr. Hollopeter, a first-year film student at the New York Film Academy, had suffered a seizure, which sent him convulsing off the platform and onto the tracks, where Mr. Autrey held him down as the train rumbled just inches above them.
Moments after the train came to a halt, Mr. Autrey recounted yesterday, Mr. Hollopeter asked if he was dead. ''I said, 'You are very much alive, but if you move you'll kill the both of us.' '' Both men emerged from the episode with little more than bruises, but Mr. Autrey also emerged a star.
Mr. Autrey, a 50-year-old construction worker, said he knew something was different when he showed up for work later on Tuesday. His boss, he said, bought him lunch -- a ham-and-cheese hero -- and later told him to take yesterday off.
Then yesterday morning, as he walked to his mother's apartment in Harlem, ''a stranger came up and put $10 in my hand,'' he said. ''People in my neighborhood were like, 'Yo, I know this guy.' ''
Once at his mother's apartment, he held interviews in the living room with some of the national morning news programs.
After that, it was back to the scene, where he recounted Mr. Hollopeter's backward tumble off the platform and into the path of the oncoming train.
Throughout the day, Mr. Autrey's sister, Linda, 48, played the role of administrative assistant, logging invitations for the talk-show circuit, including requests from the David Letterman, Charlie Rose and Ellen DeGeneres shows. Phone calls from well-wishers came pouring in, including one from the mayor's office. Mr. Autrey said he had been offered cash, trips and scholarships for his two daughters, Syshe, 4, and Shuqui, 6, who watched as he dived to the trackbed.
''Donald Trump's got a check waiting on me,'' he said. ''They offered to mail it; I said, 'No, I'd like to meet the Donald, so I can say, Yo, you're fired.' ''
By the end of the day, the president of the New York Film Academy, Jerry Sherlock, had personally handed him a $5,000 check.
Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Autrey and Mr. Hollopeter met again. The meeting was closed to reporters, but afterward Mr. Autrey described how he stepped into Mr. Hollopeter's hospital room, where they shared a few laughs as Mr. Hollopeter's father stood by with tears in his eyes.
Shortly after 4 p.m., Mr. Autrey walked out of the hospital with Mr. Hollopeter's father, Larry, and into a throng of more than 30 reporters and camera operators who jammed microphones into their faces.
''This is Cameron's father,'' Mr. Autrey began. ''He's a very, very, nice, nice man and, you know, I'm not used to this press,'' he said, as reporters shouted at them to lean closer to the microphones and camera shutters popped like party favors.
Mr. Hollopeter was nervous, his hands shaking, as he read from handwritten notes.
''Mr. Autrey's instinctive and unselfish act ---- '' Mr. Hollopeter said, hesitating, as reporters inched closer. ''There are no words to properly express our gratitude and feelings for his actions. Cameron is recovering and stable. Now he needs his rest, and our wishes are that you respect his privacy. May God's blessings be with Mr. Autrey and his family.''
The teary father then slipped back into the hospital, apparently overcome with emotion.
''Me and the families are trying to make some plans so his family can meet my family and we can have a little gathering,'' Mr. Autrey said, before breaking into a hearty laugh. ''Without the media!''
Mr. Autrey was asked to reflect on the experience.
''Maybe I was in the right place at the right time, and good things happen for good people,'' Mr. Autrey said.
Then he hopped into his brother-in-law's tan Toyota Corolla. As the car pulled away, Mr. Autrey had some final words: ''All New Yorkers! If you see somebody in distress, go for it!''

The 20-year building boom on Staten Island, long the city's fastest-growing borough, is decelerating drastically, thanks largely to a reining-in of the island's freewheeling zoning laws, officials say. According to city figures released yesterday, permits for new buildings plunged by 43 percent last year.
So substantial was the decline that Staten Island almost single-handedly accounted for a 10 percent dip in building permits citywide last year, which was the first drop in the city in a decade.
Officials say that a reining-in of the island’s freewheeling zoning laws and tax changes led to the slowdown.
The 20-year building boom on Staten Island, long the city's fastest-growing borough, is decelerating drastically, thanks largely to a reining-in of the island's freewheeling zoning laws, officials say. According to city figures released yesterday, permits for new buildings plunged by 43 percent last year.
So substantial was the decline that Staten Island almost single-handedly accounted for a 10 percent dip in building permits citywide last year, which was the first drop in the city in a decade.
In the other four boroughs, permits fell by 1.6 percent, the figures from the City Buildings Department show.
Of course, the real estate market has been cooling all over the city and the country, but city officials and real estate professionals attributed the disproportionate chill on Staten Island to zoning and tax changes.
New zoning rules passed in 2004, which were aimed at stemming a flood of town house developments that residents complained were disfiguring communities and overloading streets with traffic, require larger lots and yards and more parking. A tax abatement for new one- and two-family homes was also rescinded last year, further discouraging construction.
''It's one of these perfect-storm situations,'' said Sandy Krueger, chief executive officer of the Staten Island Board of Realtors. ''Everything kind of came together at once: the downzoning, the tax abatement removal and the change in the market. I think everybody is sort of taking a breath here and waiting this out a little bit to see what happens.''
Last year, 826 permits for new buildings were issued in Staten Island, compared with 1,441 in 2005 and nearly 2,000 in 2003. Permits for new units of housing also declined more than 40 percent through November, compared with a 1 percent drop elsewhere in the city, according to census statistics.
The downturn was broadly welcomed in a place where for years development appeared to proceed with pile driver and shoehorn. A one-acre parcel where 18 units of housing could once be built is limited to 7.
''I don't want Staten Island to stop growing,'' said the borough president, James P. Molinaro, who helped lead the drive for the zoning changes, ''but I want proper growth.''
The decline in new housing permits issued on Staten Island affected multifamily dwellings as well as smaller buildings. Permits for one-family homes fell 49 percent.
City officials pointed to several developments planned for the island that they said would be more carefully managed, including a 700-unit waterfront complex in Stapleton, north of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which is expected to bring new life to a vacant port.
As for the slight citywide drop in new building and housing permits outside of Staten Island, the city's deputy mayor for economic development, Daniel L. Doctoroff, said he saw little cause for concern. New housing construction is slowing dramatically across the country, he said, and total construction spending in New York City is increasing as builders focus on commercial projects.
''Particularly relative to the overall national housing market,'' Mr. Doctoroff said, ''and taking into account the fact that through much of the year interest rates were rising, I think by every indicator the market here was very resilient.''
Frank Naso, one of Staten Island's biggest builders and the former president of the Building Industry Association of New York City, a trade group, said that zoning changes had been long overdue.
''We needed some kind of reform,'' he said. ''We'll continue to build, but instead of building 10 you might build 6. It's not the end of the world.''
Mr. Naso was more upset about the loss of the tax abatement, which cut a homeowner's property taxes for the first eight years after purchase and allowed many first-time buyers into the market.
Jeff Gallo, an opponent of sprawl and a member of the Preservation League of Staten Island, who lives in a turn-of-the-century Victorian house in Stapleton, said he had noticed a slight calming in the air.
''There's a feeling out in Staten Island now that you just can't get away with everything,'' said Mr. Gallo, a real estate broker who works in Brooklyn.
Ever since the Verrazano-Narrows bridge was completed in 1964, linking Staten Island to the rest of New York City, people have flocked to the island, developers have worked frenetically to accommodate them, and longtime residents have bemoaned the disappearance of open space and the strain on the island's infrastructure. During the 1990s, Staten Island's population grew by 17 percent and civic discontent skyrocketed. Eventually the clamor brought results.
Before the zoning change, you were permitted to build a house with a 4-foot backyard,'' Mr. Molinaro said. ''Now you have to have a minimum of 30 feet. You were able to buy a house on Staten Island where your bottom step was the street -- there was no sidewalk. That was legal! You can't do it no more.''
Staten Island, still by far the least-populous borough in the city, was the fastest-growing county in the state, according to the 2000 census.
It is not even the fastest-growing borough in the city anymore, having fallen into a virtual tie with Manhattan. From 2003 to 2005, the population in both boroughs grew by about 0.9 percent, according to census estimates.
Helen Siegel, 52, a schoolteacher who lives in New Springville, in the center of the island, thought back yesterday to the days when cows and pigs from nearby farms used to stroll across her yard.
''It might have been better had they done this sooner,'' she said. ''It's all built up on every spare inch of land already.''

Change is in the air at the State Capitol, but the top faces in the Legislature are staying the same. The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, and the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, were both confirmed on Wednesday as the leaders of their respective chambers -- positions they have held since 1994.
Mr. Bruno was re-elected temporary president of the Senate on a unanimous voice vote despite his disclosure last month that federal authorities were looking into his business activities.

Mr. Bruno was re-elected temporary president of the Senate on a unanimous voice vote despite his disclosure last month that federal authorities were looking into his business activities.
The federal investigation did not seem to shake the confidence of the Senate's Republicans.
''We all know Joe Bruno, he knows you, and he's run this house with some efficiency not formerly seen -- starting on time; ending sessions on time, more or less; and no 4 o'clock in the morning sessions,'' Senator Owen H. Johnson, a Suffolk County Republican, said in sponsoring the resolution to re-elect Mr. Bruno as temporary president.
Not a single ''nay'' vote was heard, because Senator John J. Bonacic of the Hudson Valley, the only Republican dissenter, had left the chamber before the vote to symbolically register his protest.
''I think there's a cloud over him, and that cloud is getting thicker every day,'' Mr. Bonacic said of Mr. Bruno in an interview afterward. ''And my concern is more for the conference and the message that the conference sends out -- that it doesn't get diluted or distracted by the problems of our majority leader with the federal investigation.''
Mr. Bruno said after the vote, ''These are challenging times, these are days that are problematic -- more problematic for some than for others.'' He added, ''And I'm here now, and I can tell you, we will overcome whatever challenges are out there.''

State and federal health officials are investigating an extremely rare outbreak of encephalitis here that killed a second-grader last month and led officials to close his elementary school this week.
Health officials said the cases of encephalitis, which is usually brought on by a virus and causes the brain to swell, are unusual because they appear to be caused by a common bacteria, mycoplasma pneumoniae, or walking pneumonia.
Health officials are investigating an extremely rare outbreak of encephalitis in Warwick, R.I., that killed a second grader last month.
State and federal health officials are investigating an extremely rare outbreak of encephalitis here that killed a second-grader last month and led officials to close his elementary school this week.
Health officials said the cases of encephalitis, which is usually brought on by a virus and causes the brain to swell, are unusual because they appear to be caused by a common bacteria, mycoplasma pneumoniae, or walking pneumonia.
''It's very rare for someone to be hospitalized with mycoplasma, and it's even more rare to see such a severe complication as encephalitis,'' said Cynthia Whitney, acting branch chief for the respiratory diseases branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ''What makes this so unusual is that more than one case has been linked to this outbreak of mycoplasma.''
The second-grader, Dylan Gleavey of Warwick, died of encephalitis on Dec. 21. A classmate of Dylan's at Greenwood Elementary School became ill with meningitis that progressed to a mild form of encephalitis, said Dr. David R. Gifford, Rhode Island's director of health.
The classmate and a West Warwick middle school student who had encephalitis and walking pneumonia were recovering at home, Dr. Gifford said.
Health officials also are investigating higher-than-normal absentee rates among students in two Coventry schools who were reported to have had symptoms of walking pneumonia.
Over the weekend, Warwick officials turned Greenwood Elementary School into a makeshift clinic, swabbing throats and drawing blood from all but 3 of the 275 students, their families, teachers and staff members. Antibiotics were given to everyone who showed up.
The school was closed after five students tested positive for walking pneumonia. Mayor Scott Avedisian said officials were keeping it closed for an extra week after Christmas break so the students would be apart for two weeks, well into the incubation time of one to three weeks.
State officials said it was the first time a school had been closed for such an outbreak, and federal officials said they rarely intervened in cases of walking pneumonia.
''I've been here for 13 years, and we have not shut down a school due to mycoplasma,'' Ms. Whitney said.
Mayor Avedisian said more than 1,400 rounds of antibiotics were dispensed and nine informational sessions were held for concerned parents. Parents were notified of the illness by computerized phone calls.
Parents were upset, Mr. Avedisian said, but he said he believed they had been given enough information and the chance to ask questions.
Rather than close additional schools, officials were stressing the importance of hand washing and advising people to sneeze into their arms rather than their hands. Lisa Freeman, 41, whose three children attend Greenwood Elementary, said her entire family was taking antibiotics. Her son, Stone, was in the same class as Dylan's brother.
''It was scary, definitely scary,'' she said. ''But I feel it was handled in a very professional way.''
Ms. Freeman, her husband and children spent New Year's Day getting throat cultures, and came back the next day for blood work. Doctors discovered that Stone had an ear infection, causing neighbors and concerned parents to call and see if he was feeling all right.
''It's very close-knit here,'' Ms. Freeman said as a gaggle of neighborhood children played in her backyard. ''I think it was the right decision to close school and put us all on antibiotics.''

John D. Negroponte, whom President Bush installed less than two years ago as the first director of national intelligence, will soon leave his post to become the State Department's second-ranking official, administration officials said Wednesday.
Mr. Negroponte will fill a critical job that has been vacant for months, and he is expected to play a leading role in shaping policy in Iraq. But his transfer is another blow to an intelligence community that has seen little continuity at the top since the departure of George J. Tenet in 2004 as director of central intelligence.
John D. Negroponte, whom President Bush installed less than two years ago as the first director of national intelligence, will soon leave his post to become the State Department's second-ranking official, administration officials said Wednesday.
Mr. Negroponte will fill a critical job that has been vacant for months, and he is expected to play a leading role in shaping policy in Iraq. But his transfer is another blow to an intelligence community that has seen little continuity at the top since the departure of George J. Tenet in 2004 as director of central intelligence.
Mr. Negroponte had been brought to the intelligence job to help restore credibility and effectiveness to agencies whose reputations were badly damaged by failures related to the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, and mistaken prewar assessments of Iraq's illicit weapons. He has maintained a low public profile but provides Mr. Bush with a briefing most mornings.
President Bush has hailed the establishment of the intelligence post as an essential step in helping prevent another terrorist attack. On paper, the director of national intelligence outranks the deputy secretary of state, raising questions about why the White House would seek -- and why Mr. Negroponte would agree to -- the shift.
The move, expected to be announced this week, comes as the president prepares to announce a new strategy for Iraq as sectarian violence worsens there and approval ratings sag at home.
The administration has had great difficulty filling the State Department position. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has asked several people who have turned down the post, according to senior State Department officials.
But administration officials interviewed on Wednesday would not say whether Mr. Negroponte was moving because the White House saw him as uniquely qualified for the diplomatic post, or because President Bush was dissatisfied with his performance as intelligence chief, or whether it was a combination of the two.
Mr. Negroponte has served as ambassador to the United Nations and to Iraq, and administration officials say Ms. Rice was trying to recruit him to bring more Iraq expertise to her office.
Administration officials from two different agencies said Wednesday that the leading candidate to become the new intelligence chief is J. Michael McConnell, a retired vice admiral who led the National Security Agency from 1992 to 1996. Admiral McConnell was head of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Gen. Colin L. Powell during the first Persian Gulf war, in 1991.
Mr. Bush had at first been reluctant to set up the intelligence post, but ultimately bowed to Congressional pressure and made the office a cabinet-level position.
As deputy secretary of state, Mr. Negroponte, who would need Senate confirmation for the post, would fill a pivotal foreign policy position that has been vacant since Robert B. Zoellick resigned to take a post at Goldman Sachs.
The shift of Mr. Negroponte, first reported Wednesday evening by NBC News, reflects a further transformation in President Bush's foreign policy team that has already seen Robert M. Gates take over as defense secretary from Donald H. Rumsfeld. Mr. Bush still has other top posts to fill, including that of ambassador to the United Nations, left vacant with the departure of John R. Bolton.
Mr. Negroponte would move to the State Department as the administration is preparing a shift in Iraq strategy.
As a career diplomat who also served as ambassador to Mexico, the Philippines and Honduras, Mr. Negroponte brought a policy maker's perspective to the role of intelligence chief, a post established by Congress at the end of 2004 to address a lack of coordination among intelligence agencies. He took over the job in April 2005, and said in an interview on C-Span last month that he expected to stay in his position until the end of the Bush administration.
Admiral McConnell is a career intelligence officer who is a senior vice president of Booz Allen Hamilton, an international consulting firm. During his tenure at the Pentagon and as director of the National Security Agency, Admiral McConnell worked closely with Mr. Gates during Mr. Gates's time as deputy national security adviser and as director of central intelligence, and with Dick Cheney while he was defense secretary during the first Persian Gulf war.
Senator Susan M. Collins, Republican of Maine and chairwoman of the Senate Government Reform Committee, was a major backer of the intelligence post, and on Wednesday she said of the reported transfer: ''The director of national intelligence is an absolutely critical position. I'm disappointed that Negroponte would leave this critical position when it's still in its infancy. There are a number of people who could ably serve as deputy secretary of state, but few who can handle the challenges of chief of intelligence.''
Representative Jane Harman, a California Democrat who also pressed for establishment of the intelligence job, said: ''I'm worrying that our deficit in intelligence will not be corrected. I'm sorry Negroponte isn't completing his term because he at least understood intelligence.''
Mr. Negroponte's move to the State Department has been rumored for months. Ms. Rice was pushing to bring Mr. Negroponte in as her deputy, and officials in Washington speculated that the career diplomat might be more comfortable returning to the State Department.
The White House press secretary, Tony Snow, declined to comment on the change. ''We don't comment on personnel matters until the president has announced his intentions,'' Mr. Snow said in an e-mail message Wednesday night.
Officials said one priority in replacing Mr. Negroponte had been to select someone who could pass swiftly through the Senate confirmation process. They also cautioned that the choice of Admiral McConnell was not final.
The job of deputy director of national intelligence is also vacant, and the White House is conscious that a long nomination battle in the Senate, where Democrats are now in the majority, could throw the intelligence office into disarray.

Check the Flight Data<center></b></head><p align="left">Fans that were looking to determine whether Miami Dolphins coach Nick Saban was leaving to coach Alabama University headed to Web sites that track flight activity to see if he had telling trips planned (M)
As rumors about Alabama's coaching search reached a fever pitch here in recent weeks, many fans seeking clues about who might fill the Crimson Tide's vacancy looked to the skies.
No, not to the stars.
Football fans seeking clues about who might fill vacant college coaching positions turn to the Web to track air flight traffic to and from campus cities.
As rumors about Alabama's coaching search reached a fever pitch here in recent weeks, many fans seeking clues about who might fill the Crimson Tide's vacancy looked to the skies.
No, not to the stars.
To the planes.
Before Nick Saban announced Wednesday that he was leaving the Miami Dolphins to take over at Alabama, fans had flocked to FlightAware.com, a Web site that allows users to track flight activity. Was South Carolina Coach Steve Spurrier flying into Tuscaloosa Regional Airport? Was a plane owned by the University of Alabama departing for Norman, Okla., perhaps with university officials on their way to court Sooners Coach Bob Stoops?
''When you set out a vision for how you can help people, you can envision a whole lot of things,'' said Daniel Baker, the founder and chief executive of FlightAware.com. ''We'd like to claim we had unlimited foresight into how our service would be used, but this certainly is an unusual use for FlightAware.''
Coaching searches at other prominent college programs have also sent fans scurrying to glean information from online flight data. Internet message boards revealed that fans from Michigan State, Cincinnati and North Carolina State turned to the Web site.
Baker said he and the other 10 employees of FlightAware.com, a year-old company based in Houston, did not immediately understand the reason for spikes in the site's activity, which he said increased by about 24 percent. They knew, for example, that recent snowstorms in the Denver area generated more traffic, but the reasons for other surges were unknown until the connection was made to coaching searches. Baker said fans were also using the site to coordinate welcome-home parties at airports after a team's victory.
Baker and his staff could not have anticipated those uses by fans. Neither could Wayne Cameron, manager of the Tuscaloosa airport. He said that after Mike Shula was fired, he fielded dozens of inquiries aboutactivity at the airport.
''Everybody in the country has been tracking the university's plane and Paul Bryant Jr.'s plane,'' Cameron said. Bryant, the son of the renowned Alabama football coach Bear Bryant, is a member of Alabama's Board of Trustees and the board's athletics committee.
''They would ask who I'd seen get off planes, or if I'd seen Spurrier, or if I knew where the university plane was going,'' Cameron added. ''It was kind of like a feeding frenzy there for a few days.''
John Howard, a 25-year-old Crimson Tide fan, created the blog hirebobstoops.blogspot.com after he determined that flight activity he traced on FlightAware.com indicated that Alabama may be interested in hiring Stoops from Oklahoma.
''You have a lot of activity between Norman and Tuscaloosa,'' Howard said in an interview in early December. ''I have no clue if it's all connected, and I'm not saying it is.
''I just think it's real interesting that all these planes and these cities are connecting.''
By this week, however, signals were pointing elsewhere. Flight data turned Alabama fans' attention to Saban when reports emerged that Mal Moore, the athletic director, had flown to Miami.
Doug Walker, the university's associate athletic director for media relations, said Moore and others involved in the search knew that flights were being tracked.
''We're aware of it, but it's not affecting the way we're conducting our business,'' Walker said. ''We're not trying to conduct a world war here, we're just trying to hire a football coach.''
And Baker is only trying to operate a flight-tracking service. If fans visit his site, so be it.
''If it's all in good fun and everyone's happy, it's always a good thing,'' Baker said.
''But I wouldn't be surprised if people are losing sleep by hitting refresh on the page.''
Now Alabama's search is over, so at least Crimson Tide fans can rest.

One of two men convicted in the killing of a retired reporter for The New York Times was sentenced to 26 years in prison. The defendant, Michael C. Hamlin, had faced a term of up to 60 years after pleading guilty late last year to second-degree murder, robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery for his part in the attack on the reporter, David E. Rosenbaum, near Mr. Rosenbaum's Washington home a year ago.

A few minutes after Gov. Eliot Spitzer's address, as the crowds left the Capitol's Assembly chamber, a familiar figure walked slowly down the stairs, buffeted by the crush of bodies with nary a press secretary to smooth his passage. It was Thomas R. Suozzi, the bright, passionate Nassau County executive who ran an uphill -- some would say politically suicidal -- primary campaign against Mr. Spitzer, and lost.

''It's going to be very tough, but if there's one person who can accomplish it, it's Governor Spitzer,'' said Mr. Suozzi, who last fall attacked Mr. Spitzer for failing to prosecute Medicaid fraud, accused him of throwing ''a temper tantrum'' at one debate, and said that as a prosecutor, Mr. Spitzer did not ''understand what it takes to manage a large, complex, multibillion-dollar government.''
Asked what he thought of Mr. Spitzer's delivery, he smiled tightly and responded graciously.
''I would only wish that I could do it as well as he had done it,'' Mr. Suozzi said.

Like Halley's comet or swarms of 17-year locusts, the arrival of a freshman state senator in Albany is so rare that it provokes fascination and uncertainty in equal measure.
''There was some confusion about my chair,'' said Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the only new state senator this year. Ms. Stewart-Cousins, a Democrat, defeated a powerful and popular Republican incumbent, Nicholas A. Spano, in a close-fought election in November.
Like Halley's comet or swarms of 17-year locusts, the arrival of a freshman state senator in Albany is so rare that it provokes fascination and uncertainty in equal measure.
''There was some confusion about my chair,'' said Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the only new state senator this year. Ms. Stewart-Cousins, a Democrat, defeated a powerful and popular Republican incumbent, Nicholas A. Spano, in a close-fought election in November.
But when she arrived at the Senate chamber for a brief meeting Wednesday morning, Ms. Stewart-Cousins found that there was, literally, no place for her: Her personal chair -- bearing, like every senator's chair, a brass plaque with her name engraved on it -- had not yet arrived.
''It's supposed to come on Monday,'' she said. Luckily, a colleague, Senator George Onorato, was not there, so she was given his chair.
After Mr. Spitzer's address, Ms. Stewart-Cousins held court near an elevator bank, a stream of well-wishers and future favor-seekers clustered around her. As usual, she wore a scarf draped over one shoulder, a holdover from her early days in the Westchester County Legislature.
''Ten years ago, when I first became elected, there was another African-African woman who was elected, and people confused us,'' she said. ''I thought I would distinguish myself.'' She wore one on Wednesday, as well, like a muted victory sash.
Most everyone, she said, had been welcoming. ''Even Senator Bruno was waving at me from across the aisle, even as he was shaking Nick Spano's hand,'' Ms. Stewart-Cousins said. She herself, however, had not had a chance to say hello to Mr. Spano, her former opponent.
Her office, unlike her chair, was waiting for her when she arrived. ''I have a wonderful office,'' she said. ''It's temporary, though.'' Asked which room it was, she looked around at all the people waiting their turn with her, and lowered her voice as she smiled conspiratorially.
''I don't want anybody coming in,'' she said. Finally, she relented. ''Eight-oh-eight,'' she whispered.

My Name Is Iran  A Memoir  By Davar Ardalan  Illustrated. 323 pages. Henry Holt & Company. $24.
Iran Davar Ardalan, the author of ''My Name Is Iran,'' has spent her life bouncing back and forth between America and Iran, torn between these two poles in her family history, always finding herself an outsider in both countries, always missing one nation's traditions and ideals when living in the other.
As a high school student Ms. Ardalan -- who dropped her first name, Iran, after anti-Iranian sentiments blossomed in America in the wake of the hostage-takings in 1979 -- entered a beauty contest in Massachusetts and posed ''like Brooke Shields in her famous Calvin Klein ad''; within a few years she had moved to Iran, donned the veil and entered into an arranged marriage with a man she hardly knew. She attended a mass audience with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and chanted his name, lost in the moment ''of the Islamic dream'' ; later, feeling suffocated by her marriage and disenchanted with the direction of the revolution, she moved back to the United States, where she eventually became a producer with National Public Radio.
By turns fascinating and frustrating, Ms. Ardalan's memoir is a case study of a book in desperate need of an editor. While compelling portraits of relatives are left curiously truncated and incomplete, the volume is padded with clumsily written, New Agey asides that should have been left on the cutting-room floor.
The reader wants to know more about Ms. Ardalan's memories of life under the shah and less about her early jobs in the United States; more about what she witnessed during the Islamic Revolution of 1979 and less about her quest to see ''the oneness of humanity.'' The book lacks the keen, reportorial eye that Azadeh Moaveni demonstrated in her 2005 book ''Lipstick Jihad: A Memoir of Growing Up Iranian in America and American in Iran,'' and it most definitely lacks the lyrical power of Azar Nafisi's remarkable 2003 book ''Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books.''
What keeps the reader reading ''My Name Is Iran'' is the remarkable trajectory traced by members of three generations of Ms. Ardalan's family, as they moved back and forth between the East and West, Iran and America, trying to balance a personal equation of tradition and modernity, religious faith and individualistic freedom.
The story of her maternal grandfather, Abol Ghassem, is in itself a remarkable tale of perseverance and will. At the age of 40, Abol -- who grew up in a remote village in the Bakhtiari tribal area of Iran -- enrolled in the American Mission School, learned English alongside 7- and 8-year-olds, and eventually received a scholarship to study in America.
After attending Columbia University, he joined a carnival (where he was billed as the ''Persian Lion'') to earn money for medical school, graduated from Syracuse University Medical School at 54, and married the author's grandmother Helen, a young nurse, who had grown up in a strict Christian home in a small town, Weiser, Idaho. The couple moved to Iran in 1931, rented a large Tehran house that doubled as their private hospital, and had seven children.
''Their days began early in the morning,'' Ms. Ardalan writes, ''when Abol would rise at 4 a.m., shave his face and head, and listen to the BBC News on a shortwave radio. He would then do laps around the balcony for 20 minutes. As he ran, he recited the 'Shahnameh' '' -- an Arthurian-like epic about Iran's early kings -- ''to himself. Then, summer or winter, he would wake the children and line them up under the shower as he continued to chant to them from the 'Shahnameh.' ''
Helen and Abol eventually decided that their children should be raised in the United States, and the author's mother, Mary Nell -- the one child not given a Persian name -- was sent to a private boarding school in Washington. At 19 she met a Kurdish aristocrat named Nader Ardalan on a blind date; she soon married him and a few years later moved with him to Iran, closely following the path her mother had chosen years before. Nader, a Harvard-educated architect, had accepted a job with the National Iranian Oil Company to design worker housing and later became an associate partner in a leading architectural firm in Tehran.
In discussing her childhood in Iran and her visits to America, Ms. Ardalan does a better job conveying her own sense of emotional dislocation than giving the reader a palpable appreciation of the two very disparate worlds she straddled. Her descriptions of life in Iran under the shah feel oddly generic and familiar: ''In our school many different cultures flourished, but for the most part we were all Americanized. By 1977, the Bee Gees's hit 'Night Fever' landed in Tehran, and 'Saturday Night Fever' was the big rage.''
And her descriptions of the harshness of life in post-revolutionary Iran tend to have the impersonal feel of a wire report: ''Increasingly, the penalties imposed were gruesome and brutal. Under the penal code, the penalty for adultery for unmarried men and women was a hundred lashes of a whip.''
Toward the end of this ungainly book Ms. Ardalan asks: ''Could the telling of this story about Iran's search for a lawful society also be my conscious quest for my own identity as Iran, the woman?'' The problem is she never convinces the reader that her personal journey is more interesting than the plight of Iran, and in focusing too insistently on her own search for an identity, she seems to have squandered a splendid opportunity to give us a window on a conundrum of a country that she has known intimately through several tumultuous decades of change.

IT'S odd, the feeling of comfort you get staring up at a 103-foot-tall intercontinental ballistic missile from the bottom of a hardened silo buried in the Arizona desert.
It's not that there is any joy in knowing that an ICBM like this, the centerpiece of the Titan Missile Museum in Sahuarita, Ariz., about 20 miles south of Tucson, could have been launched in just 58 seconds, hurling a city-destroying nuclear warhead at the Soviet Union.

Cold war relics in Arizona, New Mexico and Nevada teach visitors how to love the bomb without worrying.
IT'S odd, the feeling of comfort you get staring up at a 103-foot-tall intercontinental ballistic missile from the bottom of a hardened silo buried in the Arizona desert.
It's not that there is any joy in knowing that an ICBM like this, the centerpiece of the Titan Missile Museum in Sahuarita, Ariz., about 20 miles south of Tucson, could have been launched in just 58 seconds, hurling a city-destroying nuclear warhead at the Soviet Union. Armageddon is not a pleasant prospect.
No, the sense of comfort in seeing a Titan II comes from knowing that it was never launched.
During the heart of the cold war, from the 1960s to the mid-80s, the 54 Titan II underground complexes like this one -- with its blast doors, firing console and spartan crew quarters, all preserved as the Titan Missile Museum -- were part of the American program of nuclear deterrence, on constant alert to keep aggressive impulses in the Soviet Union at bay.
''This is what it took to wage nuclear war,'' said Chuck Penson, the museum's archivist. ''And this is what it took to wage nuclear peace.''
Since those days, both the enemy and the sense of what keeps the country secure have changed. In an age of color-coded threat levels, the cold war and concepts like mutual assured destruction can seem far away. But they are kept alive at museums and historical sites like the one in Sahuarita, relics of a recent bit of American history.
I went to the Titan Museum, which is operated by the nonprofit Arizona Aerospace Foundation, on a quick trip back to that time. The journey, last fall, also took me to New Mexico, where the atomic bomb was invented, and Nevada, where it was perfected during more than three decades of atmospheric and underground testing.
Atomic tourism is not for everyone. After all, the focal point is a weapon that can, and did, kill on a horrific scale. The technology tends to appeal to those with an interest in science and engineering or the military.
But if you are so inclined, you can see things that not too long ago were among America's best-kept secrets. Mr. Penson, whose long hair makes him look like anything but a military man, guides lengthy ''top to bottom'' tours of the Titan silo (shorter tours are available, too) and will show you every last detail, down to the safe that kept the launch codes that could start World War III. At the Nevada Test Site, the Department of Energy will proudly drive you through the ground zeros of its atomic wasteland.
Albuquerque is a good place to get introduced to the atomic age. It is home to the National Atomic Museum, which is owned by the Department of Energy, the federal agency that oversees the nuclear weapons program.
The museum has basic exhibits on topics like radiation and nuclear waste, a detailed explanation of the Manhattan Project, which developed the first atom bomb, and artifacts like a calutron, an electromagnetic machine for separating the bomb-quality isotope of uranium. Thousands of these were built during World War II, and since copper was scarce, more than 14,000 tons of silver were requisitioned from the government for the electromagnets.
But most of the museum is devoted to the modern nuclear arsenal (which, despite the end of the cold war, still includes thousands of warheads deliverable by more modern ICBMs, bombers and cruise missiles). If you've ever wanted to know what your basic H-bomb looks like (with the active ingredients removed, of course), this is the place.
THE Nevada Test Site, where nuclear bombs were tested from 1951 until 1992, is on nearly 1,400 square miles of dry lake beds and mountains 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas. While much classified work continues there (including testing to ensure that weapons remain safe as they age), the historical areas are now open once a month for free all-day bus tours -- an attempt by the Energy Department ''to educate the public about what really happened out there,'' said Roger Staley, who worked at the test site for 32 years as a health physicist.
Mr. Staley was speaking from the front of a tour bus, serving as guide for a group that included a retired airline pilot from Reno, a former school worker from Oregon, a nuclear power plant operator and members of a recreational-vehicle club from nearby Pahrump, Nev. Education is not a bad idea, given the history of the testing program, including the deliberate exposure of thousands of soldiers to atomic blasts.
Mr. Staley told his passengers that there was no radiation risk. He was required to wear a dosimeter only to keep the lawyers happy. Current radiation levels where they were going, he said, were somewhere between extremely little and none at ground level.
''Beneath the ground,'' he said, ''is another matter.''
Once through a security checkpoint at the nuclear company town of Mercury, the bus wound its way up over a hill, past large ''Radiation Hazard'' signs and down into Frenchman Flat, where the first atmospheric tests (of 100 total) were conducted. Like all the tests conducted there, they had two purposes: to develop weapons and to determine their effects on life and property.
Evidence of the second purpose was all around us. As the bus headed toward the site of a 37-kiloton blast in 1957, it drove past the mangled remains of several shelters made of aluminum. Nearby was a blasted bank vault, an experiment to see whether money and valuable documents could survive nuclear war. There were twisted I-beams from a section of a trestle bridge, large poles for testing window glass and concrete bunkers that looked relatively unscathed.
Then there were the pig pens, where live pigs dressed in protective gear were exposed to blasts and examined to see how well the gear worked.
Nothing was spookier than the remains of the Apple 2 project, a 1955 explosion designed to test civil defenses. Parts of a small town were constructed for the test, with stores, cars and houses complete with refrigerators filled with food and mannequins dressed in clothing.
Most of the debris from the test has been long since carted away, but a two-story house remains, about a mile from ground zero. It was weather-beaten and lacked windows and the chimney had been shifted off its foundation, but otherwise it seemed normal, just another abandoned building baking in the Nevada sun.
Atmospheric testing was banned by treaty in 1963; from then until 1992, the site was the scene of more than 825 underground tests, most of which left subsidence craters on the surface.
The test site is so peppered with these craters that from some vantage points you'd think you were on the moon. The bus actually drove down into one: Bilby, created in 1963 by the detonation of a 249-kiloton bomb buried several thousand feet underground.
As craters go, however, none can match Sedan, in the northeast corner of the test site. The 1962 Sedan test was part of Operation Plowshare, a program to see if nuclear bombs could be used for peaceful purposes -- in this case, creating harbors or canals.
A 104-kiloton hydrogen bomb left a crater 320 feet deep and about 1,300 feet wide -- a magnificent yawning space that can be viewed from a small platform at the edge.
The problem, Mr. Staley said, was that the explosion also sent a large plume of radioactive dust into the atmosphere. ''If we had known what would happen, we wouldn't have done the test,'' he said.
The Plowshare experiments were eventually discontinued.
WITH more than 900 tests over four decades, it seems as if technicians must have been constantly detonating bombs at the Nevada Test Site. By contrast, at a Titan II silo, a nine-megaton W-53 warhead could sit atop a missile for years, waiting for a launch order that never came.
At the Titan Museum, Yvonne Morris, the director, who as a young Air Force missile crew commander in the early 80s worked 24-hour shifts at this and other silos, said the warhead was almost the last thing to worry about. The complex was full of equipment and systems that could, and did, fail.
While on duty, ''I wasn't thinking about 'Is today the day I might have to fire the missile?' '' she said. ''I was thinking about: 'Is today the day that they're doing a propellant operation at my site? I really hate those, because so much can go wrong.' ''
Mr. Penson, Ms. Morris's colleague at the museum, may not have shared her military experience, but you'd never know it from the in-depth tours he leads -- he can describe practically every piece of equipment in the silo. He knows, for instance, that the diesel fuel tank for the emergency generator is about the only item that isn't shock-mounted. Just about everything else, from the light fixtures to the entire crew module to the missile itself, is suspended from springs, as protection from blast shock in the event the Soviets struck before the Titan could be launched.
In all, it's an impressive demonstration of technology -- granted, early '60s technology -- that was dedicated, at fabulous expense, to one goal: keeping the missile ready for a launching that the whole country hoped would not be needed.
''Which was really the idea behind this,'' Mr. Penson said. ''To never use it.''

THOUGH nuclear bombs tests and Titan missile silos are identified with the open spaces of the West, the fear of Soviet attack also had the East on edge. Most of the Nike missile sites that once ringed New York, Philadelphia and Washington, ready to shoot down enemy planes that swooped too close, have been paved over or are capped off and overgrown with trees. But there are still places in the East that provide windows into the world of cold war defense.
New Jersey: Fort Hancock
This former army base at Sandy Hook, N.J., guarded New York Harbor until 1974 and is now part of the 26,000-acre Gateway National Recreation Area. With 24 nuclear warheads at one time, its arsenal was substantial. What remains are three unarmed missiles and an attendant radar site.

From April through October, half-hour walking tours led by military veterans meet on weekends at the radar site's gate, and more comprehensive tours are given monthly. For details, call 732-872-5970 or check www.nps.gov/gate.
West Virginia: The Greenbrier
At this sprawling old resort in Sulphur Springs, W.Va., beyond what is today a spa and three golf courses, a 112,000-square-foot bunker was carved into the side of a mountain as the secret refuge for Congress in case of nuclear attack. Lawmakers were to cast votes in an air-locked, radiation-free complex and then bunk alongside their cross-the-aisle rivals upstairs.
Despite its size and the presence of a secret staff disguised as TV repairmen, the bunker was unknown to even longtime Greenbrier employees until The Washington Post published an article about it in 1992. ''There were plenty of rumors,'' said Dr. Robert Conte, the resort's historian, who has worked there for 28 years, ''but I couldn't get them confirmed.''
Tours (age 10 and up) cost $20 and last about 90 minutes; no cameras are allowed. For reservations, call 800-453-4858.
Florida: Peanut Island
Of course, the president needed fallout protection even if he was kicking back in Palm Beach, as John F. Kennedy often did. So a bunker came to the president, built on nearby Peanut Island. Though the exterior resembles an earthen Quonset hut, the inside is vintage Cuban missile crisis, with old cans of water, collapsible spoons and President Kennedy's desk.
Tours ($10) are conducted on weekends by the Palm Beach Maritime Museum (561-832-7428, www.pbmm.org).
Massachusetts: Chesterfield
A Grange hall, general store and 18th-century houses don't scream high-value target, but with a key interstate telephone line running through Chesterfield, a few miles west of Northampton, the government wasn't taking any chances. Outside town, a 40,000-square-foot bunker was buried 40 feet below ground in the early 1960s.
Today it houses Chesterfield Custom, a manufacturer of vinyl organizers and other office products, though it retains details like toilets spring-mounted to absorb shocks in an attack.
Frank Keefe, the company's chief executive, said that this bunker was where Richard Nixon's daughter Julie was to seek shelter if a war broke out while she was attending Smith College. ''There can be a blizzard going on, and you would never know it,'' Mr. Keefe said.
You can drive by 11 Bofat Hill Road, off East Street (Chesterfield Road), to judge for yourself.

Sam aspires to ride with the goggle-tanned gods who throw slow-motion 900s off flesh-eating cliffs and drop out of helicopters to outride thundering avalanches. Given his dream, the path was clear. Sam convinced his parents to buy him a season pass to the new Neverland of freestyle stunt pilots, Echo Mountain Park, near Evergreen, Colo.
Perched at 10,500 feet with wraparound views of the frosted Rockies, Echo is the nation's first winter resort devoted exclusively to the contagious urge to ''go huge'' and ''get your switch-front boardslides dialed.'' There are no gently groomed slopes, no wide cruiser runs, not even a single mogul field. Echo is 100 percent terrain park -- 50 acres of jumps, rails, boxes, picnic tables, stairs, mailboxes and pipe. With a good-times agenda, Echo aims to be the X Games proving ground for the young and indestructible.
Echo, 35 miles west of Denver, bodaciously bills itself as ''the most exciting place to be with snow pants on.'' So on opening weekend in late November Sam Buckmelter came to guinea-pig the claim.
He and an army of bandana-masked snow desperadoes -- freestyle skiers and snowboarders jacked up on SoBe Full Throttle -- got their shred on until 9 p.m. under lights that blazed like a Swedish solstice. They pinwheeled across monster gaps and surfed curvaceous dragon rails in ''steezy'' hood ornament poses while Echo's jukebox rocked the freestyle world with their favorite thrasher tunes.
Few parents could be found on the Echo slopes -- the energy, aesthetics, acoustics and entire ethos of the place is aimed at kids. Echo's owner, Jerry Petitt, said he hadn't built the park to please everyone. He has carved out a narrow, vigorous niche within the ski and snowboard market and is raising his newborn resort with a lot of parenting advice from the very 12- to 29-year-olds he hopes to serve. ''It's nothing against places like Aspen, but the young people we consulted early on told us they can't afford to pay $75 for a lift ticket or $14 for a buffalo burger,'' Mr. Petitt said. ''What kept coming back to us was: 'Keep it inexpensive. Make it for us.' ''
The lift tickets at Echo are priced for teenagers on a lawn-mowing budget, and the cuisine is spartan even by cafeteria standards: energy bars and nuke-able burritos from vending machines.
Mr. Petitt bought the Echo property in 2003 for a mere $700,000. It was just a small defunct ski hill in the midst of a wooded 240-acre lot then. ''I called my wife and said, 'We've just bought a ski area!' which went over really well,'' he said.
Still a passionate skier at 61, Mr. Petitt invested $5 million to develop the first 50 acres into a terrain park, hiring Planet Snow Design, the company that built the superpipe for the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games, to finesse the flow on each slope. They mixed boxes, stairs and rail sequences on one run, a medley of jumps and rocketing ''kickers'' on another. For rookies laying the foundations for their melon grabs and switch noseslides, they installed a ''progression center.''
''We've got to let our riders create us,'' said Eric Petitt, 30, Jerry's son and the architect of Echo's guerrilla marketing campaign, which focuses on an interactive Web site with a ''rant'' page where kids weigh in on what they want Echo to be. He hopes to make Echo a year-round park, implementing the ideas generated in Echo's chat rooms -- rock climbing, mountain biking, all-terrain skateboarding, even zip-lining.
''We're not going to build any million-dollar homes or stone-and-timber lodges strewn with bearskin rugs,'' said Doug Donovan, 34, the general manager, surveying his singularly young clientele swigging Red Bull while recharging by the Xbox at the base lodge. ''It's going to have a rock concert feel to it every day.''
Echo's architecture makes creative use of pre-fab industrial design, with corrugated steel and glass jutting out at crisp angles. Underground snowboarding and freestyle ski brands like 4frnt, Unity and Capita are stickered liberally on chair backs, tables and garbage cans. The walls are hung with artwork by Denver area rider-artists -- a Japanese woodblock print of Mount Fuji with a snowboarder flying through the air, psychedelic abstracts painted on skateboards.
''We looked at the industry and realized it's impossible to build a new Vail,'' Mr. Donovan said. ''Their model is a giant real estate play more than anything. But if you're looking to make money on the slopes, you build a skateboard park on snow, close to a metropolitan area.''
All the growth over the last five years, Mr. Donovan argued, has come from snowboarders, freestyle skiers and the terrain parks that reel them in. Conglomerates like Intrawest, Vail Corporation and American Skiing Company have gobbled up full-service winter resorts where affluent baby boomers spend as much time shopping at Ralph Lauren and dining on corn-fed elk as they do out on the blue and green groomer runs. That has opened the door for smaller, easy-to-get-to day slopes to attract young, underserved locals with more chutzpah and less cash.
BEFORE starting Echo, Mr. Donovan and Jerry Petitt looked at a trio of resorts in California -- Bear Mountain, Boreal and Mountain High -- that converted their beginner and intermediate slopes into terrain parks and halfpipes over the last several years, tripling their number of visitors per acre. Other small-scale ski slopes like Mountain Creek Resort in Vernon, N.J., followed suit, and megaresorts from Killington to Mammoth dialed up the wattage on their trickster terrain. But Echo is the only resort to be built expressly for baby boomers' kids -- ''echo boomers'' like Sam Buckmelter.
Figuring prominently in Sam Buckmelter's's personal pantheon of slope stylists are Pat Milbery and Chad Otterstrom. Both are professional shredders who came to Echo on Thanksgiving weekend to impart nuggets of launching and looping wisdom at a Pro Series Camp. ''There was nothing like Echo when I was a kid,'' lamented Mr. Milbery, 22. ''I learned how to ride by building jumps on the hill behind our house. This place is an incubator for the future of the sport -- it's going to spawn bazillions of talented young riders who'll invent moves we've never dreamed of!''
''Yeah, if I'm still in one piece by the time I'm as old as you, Milbery!'' Sam Buckmelter said as he hiked up the hill. ''Right now I'm learning to pop off of jumps with steeze'' -- style -- ''but one day, I'm going to throw something big off of that.''
That is a 1961 Tucker Sno-Cat. Back in the day, it groomed this former mom-and-pop one-rope-tow hill. Echo's staff painted it an electric slime green and recycled it as the platform for a house rail, a trapezoid of logs with steel rails embedded in the tops. While the campers were working on their shred cred, Echo was christening the Sno-Cat rail by holding a jibbing contest (jibbing being the term for riding gantlets of obstacles embedded in the slopes) sponsored by Rome, a low-profile snowboard and apparel company with the advertising mantra ''Corrosion of the Corporate.''
Ten brothers of the board were swarming around the Sno-Cat, taking turns shredcasting the contest with a handheldmike.
''Next rider steppin' up is Lance Machado out of Breckenridge, Co-lo-ra-do,'' one brother drawled with snow gangsta elocution. ''This jibber is comin' in fast, firin' it up, takin' it air  borne! Pullin' a corked three outta the hat.'' (Read: helicoptering 360 degrees on a tipped axis.) ''That, my friends, is Lance-the-Ripper!''
Mr. Machado, the stringy 19-year-old who won the contest, favors a sartorial style borrowed from pioneer punk rockers like Iggy Pop and the Ramones -- skinny jeans and tight striped T-shirts -- placing him in a sectarian group within the soul-patched, hip-hop-influenced snowboard tribe: the sub-subculture sometimes derogatively labeled Emos. ''I always hear, 'Are those pants painted on or something?' from what I call the 'food court gangstas,' '' Mr. Machado said.
The politics of shred fashion are murky. But there is a shared ethic behind Mr. Machado's punk-chic and the standard saggy pants and XXL parkas: Both are anti-brand and, if possible, label averse. It's a culture of irreverent individualism to which the Echo design team is acutely sensitive.
Loud banners advertising overexposed corporate brands (Burton, Salomon, Oakley) are shunned here. Only the Echo insignia is stamped on the park's centerpiece, a 23-foot-high structure shaped like a Stomp Rocket called Knuckles that riders and skiers slide up, flip off and soar over.
''Without a doubt, there'll be some carnage off of it,'' said Marc Vitelli, who helped design Knuckles. ''For those who dare ride up it, it's game on -- anything can happen!'' he shouted as a twin-tip skier popped off the hip, arcing backward, arms outspread, a snowboarding Greg Louganis tracing the sky with his fingertips. Seconds later, the rider lawn-chaired (collapsed) on impact.
''Insufficient rotation'' was Mr. Vitelli's critique, though he whooped approvingly. The only way to learn how to stomp tricks, he said, is by going huge and embracing the occasional yard sale (a total wipeout that litters gear all over the slope).
Alas, there are no heated pools at Echo to soak battered body parts at the end of the day, and in fact no overnight facilities at this stage. ''Unless you want to crash on my couch,'' offered Mr. Vitelli, who lives in Evergreen. Eventually, Echo may add a youth hostel-style bunkhouse to spare its customers multiple laps driving up and down the steep, sometimes treacherous 12-mile road between Evergreen and the resort.
But Echo has its advantages. Set in the front range of the Rockies, it typically gets late snows that can last until May. And unlike most Colorado resorts, it isn't on Forest Service land, so there's no regulated close date. Most riders won't complain about the drive back and forth from Denver, since they'll completely bypass the I-70 parking lot of weekend skier traffic, and pay less than half the price of tickets at the ski-tropolises on the other side of the conga line.
Still, Echo isn't likely to spark a flood of émigrés from stodgy megaresorts. But for the Sam Buckmelters who are coming up at a time when freestyle skiing and boarding are gaining legitimacy, Echo could be the fuse that lights the next revolution in snow sliding.
''I'm stoked,'' Sam said.
BOARD AND MORE
ECHO MOUNTAIN PARK (303-325-7347; www.echomountainpark.com), 35 miles from Denver, is open daily from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Lift tickets are $25 on weekdays, $35 on weekends (less if you buy in ''six-packs'' or ''three-packs'') and $20 after 4 p.m.
Boards, boots and twin-tip skis can be rented from Echo's Garage, the park's retail and rental shop, for $25 a day.
Events are held every weekend, like the Shut Up and Snowskate competition tomorrow and the Armashreddin' Colorado versus Colorado State battle on Jan. 20. The Sports Monster League on Wednesday nights is billed as the first social snow-sports league in Colorado.

257 <html><head><b><center>HAVENS | Panama City Beach, Fla.; A Vacation Town Tries to Take Off Its Blue Collar<center></b></head><p align="left">Article on Panama City Beach, Fla, as place to live or visit; photos; map (M)
LIKE a supermodel showing off her good side, Panama City Beach is not shy about flaunting its most valuable asset. ''The World's Most Beautiful Beaches,'' boasts the sign at the end of Hathaway Bridge, which leads into the city.
But anyone driving through this resort on the Florida Panhandle can't fail to notice the honky-tonk strip on the main drag, Thomas Drive: video arcades, body piercing shops, tattoo parlors, adult novelty shops, down-at-the-heels motels, vacant lots. All this, city boosters insist, is the old Panama City Beach.
Signs of change are everywhere in this resort on the Florida Panhandle, from its $330 million airport project to the many luxury high-rises sprouting up.
LIKE a supermodel showing off her good side, Panama City Beach is not shy about flaunting its most valuable asset. ''The World's Most Beautiful Beaches,'' boasts the sign at the end of Hathaway Bridge, which leads into the city.
But anyone driving through this resort on the Florida Panhandle can't fail to notice the honky-tonk strip on the main drag, Thomas Drive: video arcades, body piercing shops, tattoo parlors, adult novelty shops, down-at-the-heels motels, vacant lots. All this, city boosters insist, is the old Panama City Beach.
Fix your gaze directly across the street at the high-rise condominiums stacked like dominoes on the dunes. This is the resort's new face, with units in the most exclusive buildings selling for as much as $1.5 million. Here and there are the old narrow, two-story mom-and-pop motels that date from the 1940s and 1950s. But most have been bulldozed. Signs of change are everywhere, from the construction crews clogging the roads to the soaring cranes that hover above the clear emerald waters and white beaches of the Gulf of Mexico.
Like much of Florida, Panama City Beach has been hurt by the downturn in the real estate market. But what sets the resort apart is the planned construction -- scheduled to begin in late spring-- of a $330 million international airport to replace the outdated Panama City-Bay County International Airport. The new airport, scheduled to open in late 2009, will have longer runways to handle larger jets, opening the resort to more domestic and international markets.
Currently, 83 percent of the city's four million tourists arrive by car. With the new airport, that will change. And Panama City Beach is betting that the new visitors filling those jets will have money to spend.
''We're going from what used to be a blue-collar resort and sharing that with a higher-end customer,'' said Bob Warren, president of the Panama City Beach Convention & Visitors Bureau.
That housing prices are still low compared with Florida's other coastal resorts has also caught the attention of real estate investors. ''This is like an undiscovered little gold mine right now,'' said Mark McSparin, an investor from Charleston, Ill., who has bought several dozen condos in Panama City Beach in the last three years and who has his own condo there.
The Scene
Even in peak summer season, the area's 17-plus miles of beach are rarely crowded. ''It's not like Coney Island, where you're stepping all over each other,'' said Patricia Remer, a native New Yorker who now lives in Birmingham, Ala. Mrs. Remer bought a three-bedroom, two-bath house one block off the beach in 2001 for $113,000, which she has on the market for $249,000. She plans to move to a waterfront condo so she can walk out her door and feel the sand between her toes.
''It's so peaceful,'' she said. ''I get my umbrella, my chair, a bottle of water and a book, and I could just stay there forever.''
In winter, the families from Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee retreat to make way for snowbirds from the Upper Midwest and Canada, most of whom rent condos for a few months. Some even swim in the chilly waters, which shocks local residents. ''I guess it's hot to them,'' said Jack Mashburn, a longtime resident of the county. ''Nobody here would dare put a foot in the gulf in February.''
Just off the beach, on the strip, are family activities that range from amusement parks and go kart tracks to water parks and miniature golf. A Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum opened last summer. And there are alligators, stingrays and performing dolphins at Gulf World Marine Park.
If you can get past the restaurants shaped like pirate ships and seafood places with names like Captain Crabby's, there are plenty of chances to commune with nature. The beach is flanked by state parks with pristine coastline, walking trails and fishing. Boating on the gulf is popular, as is fishing for flounder, trout, redfish, snapper and grouper. You can swim with dolphins for $49 a person. There are airboat tours of nearby rivers and marshes.
Panama City Beach has had a reputation for years as a spring-break destination for college students, although it has faded somewhat as the old motels disappear and the owners of condo buildings set strict rules. ''Spring breakers are a lot better behaved,'' said Patrick Pfeffer, who owns Club La Vela. ''You don't see as much nudity and throwing TVs out of the windows.''
You can still kiss your quiet time goodbye in March, though, when the beach is jam-packed with college students dancing to live bands and playing volleyball. Club La Vela, which has a capacity of 6,000 indoors and outdoors, books national acts like Aerosmith and Stone Temple Pilots and is periodically host to MTV. Spinnaker Beach Club holds 2,000 revelers.
Pros
Except for spring break, Panama City Beach is family-oriented. Rosemary Butler, of Dallas, Ga., remembers traveling to Panama City with her parents in the 1950s when Thomas Drive was a dirt road. After two condos, she and her husband bought a single-family house so they could be host to their extended family. ''We buzz across the street in our golf cart, go to our boat and take off,'' Mrs. Butler said.
Cons
Most residents welcome the changes, but some are unhappy that high-rises have obliterated the dunes and blocked the gulf view from the street. A few buildings tower 35 stories above the sand, but rules put into effect two years ago now limit buildings to 22 stories. ''If I had my choice, we would never have built anything on the beach side of the street,'' said the city's mayor, Gayle Oberst. ''But we're 50 years too late.''
Wayne Kirby, also of Dallas, Ga., misses the relaxed pace of the days before high-rises. He started vacationing in Panama City Beach in the 1950s, staying with his family in one of the old mom-and-pop motels. He bought a condo in a two-story building on the beach in 1987 for $67,000, but finally sold it last November after years of pressure from developers. It will be torn down to make way for another high-rise.
''We were so happy where we were,'' Mr. Kirby said. ''We could sit on our deck and watch the grandkids play on the beach and not have to worry about them. I'm not against growth, but I believe the growth has gotten out of hand.''
The Real Estate Market
As the number of unsold properties grows -- there are 2,000 condos in Panama City Beach for sale, according to Katie Patronis, a broker for Century 21 Ryan Realty-- construction of new units continues. Although four projects were delayed in 2006 and 12 postponed, another 22 are under way, said Mr. Warren of the visitors bureau; altogether, that's almost 7,000 units.
Units stay on the market an average of 180 days before being sold.
People who bought a condo in the pre-construction stage two years ago, Ms. Patronis said, ''are closing on their property now and paying more than what it's worth.'' Sales of existing condo units were down 45 percent in 2006, she said, but sales of new condos were up by 3 percent.
The median price of a condo in Panama City Beach is $316,000, up from $118,000 in 2000. But that's down from the peak of $385,000 in 2005.
Prices range from $150,000 for a studio or a unit not facing the gulf to $2 million. A single-family home a half-mile from the beach is about $150,000. New three-story, Key West-style houses near the beach are $450,000 to $500,000. Three-bedroom single-family houses in the Martinique development, on an artificial lake, start at $500,000.
But no matter how skittish investors are, city officials and real estate professionals in the long run see nothing but blue skies over an emerald sea. ''The market will take care of itself,'' said Mayor Oberst. ''The northwest part of Florida has been discovered. Everybody wants to live here.''
LAY OF THE LAND
POPULATION -- 11,477, according to a 2005 estimate by the Census Bureau. In peak season, the population rises to at least 35,000, according to the city's planning and zoning department.
SIZE -- About seven square miles, according to Census figures.
WHO'S BUYING -- Families with young children and baby boomers nearing retirement. Most come from cities like Atlanta, Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville, Tenn., and Louisville, Ky.
GETTING THERE -- Panama City Beach is about 130 miles west of Tallahassee and 95 miles east of Pensacola. The nearest major highway is Interstate 10. From the north, take Route 231 south, which crosses Interstate 10, then take Route 98 west for about six miles.

MAYA ANGELOU has lived in New York many times. She has had apartments in Brooklyn and on Central Park West and Riverside Drive. But three years ago she decided it was time to buy a brownstone in Harlem.
It was to be a retreat from her full-time residence, an 18-room house in Winston-Salem, N.C., where she is the Reynolds professor of American Studies at Wake Forest University. Ms. Angelou wanted a space in which to entertain her legions of friends in New York, dating from her first visit to the city in the early 1950s. Unlike most second-home owners, she was looking for a getaway to the city -- not from it. And she soon found it.
Maya Angelou’s second home, a brownstone in the most-sought-after area in Harlem, is an urban getaway filled with art, sunlight and color.
MAYA ANGELOU has lived in New York many times. She has had apartments in Brooklyn and on Central Park West and Riverside Drive. But three years ago she decided it was time to buy a brownstone in Harlem.
It was to be a retreat from her full-time residence, an 18-room house in Winston-Salem, N.C., where she is the Reynolds professor of American Studies at Wake Forest University. Ms. Angelou wanted a space in which to entertain her legions of friends in New York, dating from her first visit to the city in the early 1950s. Unlike most second-home owners, she was looking for a getaway to the city -- not from it. And she soon found it.
''This was the first and only house I looked at,'' she said one mild morning in December as she sat in her breakfast nook in Harlem, sipping a glass of ice water and looking chic in a V-neck black velvet chemise and a triple strand of freshwater pearls, her gently curled salt and pepper hair framing her unlined face. She used the verb loosely. In fact, no one had ''looked at'' the four-story brownstone at all. Longtime friends, the musicians Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson, caught wind of this landmark property for sale and placed a $10,000 deposit on it for her. Built in 1881, the house is nearly 4,000 square feet and sits on a historic block of 120th Street in the Mount Morris Park neighborhood, the most-sought-after area in Harlem.
But it was a decrepit wreck and tied up in litigation as well. Competing claims took two years to sort out. ''I got the house, and then I saw what I got,'' said Ms. Angelou, 78, speaking in her trademark majestically enunciated syllables with enough space between them for the drama of the tale to sink in. ''It had been vandalized and rained in; there was no floor between the first and second stories and no stairs. A lot of the wainscoting and the newel post were buried under debris in the backyard with nine coats of paint on them.'' At that low point, she intoned wryly, her performer's voice dropping to great effect, ''I owned an address.''
It took a gut renovation to turn the shell into the stunning, high-ceilinged home it is today, with five bedrooms, three full bathrooms and two half bathrooms. ''I was blessed and highly favored, and it only took nine months to finish,'' Ms. Angelou said with some awe, still finding such a timely transformation hard to believe.
Her own well-publicized transformation is far more remarkable -- from her dirt-poor childhood in Stamps, Ark., to her current iconic literary prominence, by way of California, Egypt, Ghana and finally North Carolina. The best-selling first volume of her autobiography ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' is required reading for millions of American students; her collection of poems ''Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'Fore I Diiie'' was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. She has written, produced, directed and starred in productions for stage, film and television, and has long been a civil rights activist.
Her front parlor is not unlike Ms. Angelou herself: vivid and a little larger than life (though a bit frail, she is six feet tall). Oversize armchairs and couches are upholstered in raw silk in shades of lime, tangerine, cherry, grape and bright yellow. The grouping gives new meaning to the phrase eye candy, but it wasn't candy Ms. Angelou had in mind when she chose them. ''I wanted the room to look like a bowl of summer fruit,'' she said. And to accentuate the point, a bowl of perfectly formed glass fruit in jewel-like colors sits in the center of a marble-topped table, topped by a single glass cherry.
The house is 20 feet wide and 50 feet deep. The dining room is behind the parlor, dominated by a round glass-topped table that seats 10 in bright red lacquered chairs. Painted clouds drift overhead on the light blue ceiling. Ms. Angelou still enjoys cooking in the well-equipped kitchen off the dining room; steak and kidney pie with mashed potatoes is a favorite. At the back of the house is her favorite spot, the breakfast nook -- sunlit and painted marigold with terra cotta-colored trim. From its black-and-white checkered farm table, she fields calls, jots on ever-present yellow legal pads and issues instructions to her assistant, Lydia Stuckey, who lives and travels with her, staying in a ground-floor bedroom when they are at the Harlem house. Ms. Angelou loves several other spaces in her house, but, she says, ''Sooner or later, I end up back here.''
THESE days, the nook occasionally serves as a studio for her newest venture: a weekly talk show on the Oprah & Friends Channel on XM Satellite Radio. ''It's the first radio show I've had,'' she said, gesturing to a pair of headphones and a pile of audio taping equipment stacked nearby. Sex, religion, race, music and food are all fodder for the program.
An elegant stairway arises from the front entryway, although an elevator carries Ms. Angelou to the blue master bedroom (years of professional dancing have taken a toll on her hips and knees). A 46-inch TV faces her crisply dressed king-size bed, and a 15-foot bay window framed by burgundy brocade draperies overlooks 120th Street. A glimpse outside reveals a row of Victorian lampposts lining the block, which carry red banners that proclaim ''Welcome to Mount Morris Park Historic District.'' Another bedroom serves as a dressing room.
On the top floor are a laundry room and the two other bedrooms, where Ms. Angelou's son Guy Johnson, 61, and his family, stay when they visit from Oakland, Calif. For their Christmas visit, Ms. Angelou planned a special treat for her two great-grandchildren, Caylin Johnson, 8, and Brandon Bailey Johnson, 5 -- a lighted seven-foot figure from ''The Nutcracker'' in the yard.
Inside, eye-catching artifacts of rarer quality are on display everywhere. They vary from luminous paintings of African women ferrying babies in slings to charming drawings of little African-American girls wearing yarn ribbons in their hair, resembling illustrations from the 1950s. African masks, quilts, photographs and sculpture sit on tables, hang on walls, line stairways. Collages by Phoebe Beasley are scattered through the rooms. ''I bought most of the sculpture in Ghana 45 years ago, and I've been collecting Phoebes since the early 1970s,'' Ms. Angelou said.
There are works, too, by the Harlem artist Romare Bearden. A 4-by-7-foot fabric piece by Faith Ringgold, who specializes in painted story quilts, was a gift from Oprah Winfrey that was commissioned for Ms. Angelou's 60th birthday. And awaiting proper placement upstairs is a framed two-page newspaper spread that appeared in The New York Times on Jan. 21, 1993, including a photograph of Ms. Angelou delivering her poem ''On the Pulse of Morning,'' written for the inauguration of President Bill Clinton.
Ms. Angelou's neighborhood is one of the most gentrified in Harlem. The actress Marcia Gay Harden and her family live nearby. Three total renovations are under way on Ms. Angelou's block, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has bought another house on the street. Contractors hold sidewalk conferences all day long. Emperor's Roe, a caviar and wine bar and fine-foods shop, and Settepani, an upscale bakery cafe, are nearby. And Sylvia's, the legendary soul-food restaurant that is one of Ms. Angelou's favorite spots, is not far.
THIS is a neighborhood where ravaged brownstones bought for $67,000 in 1996 sold for $500,000 this year, said Willie Kathryn Suggs, owner of Willie Kathryn Suggs Harlem Real Estate. Ms. Angelou declined to divulge what she paid when she bought her New York house in 2003, but Harlem real estate brokers said that similar properties (in similarly horrible shape) were selling for a minimum of $500,000 at the time. ''Hundreds of thousands of dollars went into her renovation,'' Ms. Suggs added. ''With the celebrity factor and the landmark status, I'd list her property at $3.4 million today.''
Harlem real estate agents see Ms. Angelou herself as an agent of change -- ''She's a god here,'' Ms. Suggs said. And Ms. Angelou seems to live easily with her fame in this milieu. As a tour bus lumbered down her street she acknowledged that yes, they know where she lives. ''Sometimes people get out and pose for photographs on the steps!'' she said with some wonderment.
Never a fan of flying, she has given it up nearly entirely because, she said, smiling and shaking her head slightly, ''I've become very well known. I look a lot like Maya Angelou. People come up and throw their babies into my arms.'' But she gets around on a private coach bus that sleeps six, piloted by a professional driver. Decorated in kente cloth, with its own doorbell, the bus serves as Ms. Angelou's other home away from home. When she's in Manhattan, it's parked in New Jersey.
She makes the trip to New York every two or three months, staying from a few days to a week or more, a rhythm that feels exactly right. ''I stay away long enough so that when I come back it is new and familiar at the same time,'' she explained. Her Harlem house is much more than a vacation place or a simple change of scenery. It's a true second home.
''I never agreed with Thomas Wolfe,'' she remarked quietly. ''I never thought you can't go home again. I've been coming home to Harlem for 50 years.''
AWAY
Correction:  January 12, 2007, Friday  A picture caption with an article last Friday about the writer Maya Angelou's part-time home in New York misstated the number of its rooms. It has 12 rooms -- not 18, which is the number of rooms in her home in Winston-Salem, N.C.

MY grandfather, Theodore Anton Gehrig Sr., was Lou Gehrig's first cousin.
When I was a girl, Grandpa would tell us that when he was growing up in Milwaukee, he'd go to Lou's games whenever Lou passed through town on barnstorming tours. Grandpa, who's been gone awhile, used to say that I should write Eleanor, Lou's widow. I wish I'd done it -- but I didn't want to seem as if I were being greedy or wanted something from her.
A distant relative of Lou Gehrig’s turned to eBay to find dozens of items of memorabilia she treasures as a link to her famous heritage.
MY grandfather, Theodore Anton Gehrig Sr., was Lou Gehrig's first cousin.
When I was a girl, Grandpa would tell us that when he was growing up in Milwaukee, he'd go to Lou's games whenever Lou passed through town on barnstorming tours. Grandpa, who's been gone awhile, used to say that I should write Eleanor, Lou's widow. I wish I'd done it -- but I didn't want to seem as if I were being greedy or wanted something from her.
So today, we don't have anything from Lou through the family. But there's eBay. In fact, I wish I'd started with it earlier.
Before, it was hard to find Lou Gehrig stuff here in Wisconsin, although sometimes I'd find specialty shops with things like limited-edition plates or ornaments. My sister would also try to find stuff, but she's not into it as much as I am. Here at my house in Racine, we have a room downstairs with all the Lou Gehrig memorabilia I've bought off eBay. The mailman is probably getting mad at me by now.
We have about 75 items, including figurines, books, old newspaper articles and advertisements featuring Lou, items with Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth together -- all things I want to pass on to my children. My dad, who's 81, is excited about it. He didn't collect Lou Gehrig stuff when he was younger; he had a hard enough time raising eight of us kids. My family, especially my mom and my aunt, likes to see the new stuff I've gotten every time they come by. The pictures are all up on the wall, and in one of the bedrooms I have a shelf with all the books and figurines.
I get a lot of e-mail from eBay sellers who see my name and ask me if I'm related to Lou. They're surprised that I am, since Lou didn't have any brothers or sisters who made it past childhood, and also because he and Eleanor didn't have any children. Grandpa's dad was a brother of Lou's dad. It's a distant relationship, but it's there. The eBay sellers seem glad when something they sell goes to the Gehrig family.
I spend a couple of hours online every day and check my auctions about four times a day. Sometimes, when I see something with Lou's name on it, I think to myself, ''Wow, that's my name up there.''
The first item I ever purchased was a gold coin with Lou's picture on it, but one of the items I cherish most is a photo of him giving his farewell speech on Lou Gehrig Day. He's at home plate, scratching his head, and all of the old-time microphones are there. The photo isn't an original print, but it's a limited edition.
I've also got a Lou Gehrig pocketknife, a talking Christmas ornament and a picture of Lou dressed up as a cowboy in the 1938 Western ''Rawhide.'' He looks real funny dressed in leather like that.
Of the newspaper ads, one has Lou selling Williams Shaving Cream, which was supposed to ''take the starch out of whiskers.'' Another is of him selling Camel cigarettes. Then there's one for Royal Crown Cola that says the soda was Lou's secret for hitting home runs.
I've got a 1932 newspaper from when the Yankees beat the Chicago Cubs in the World Series.
I couldn't believe it when I first saw them, but now I also have three different bobbleheads. They're all in their boxes, and that's where they're going to stay. I want to get an autographed ball one day, but those are getting pretty high-priced. They go for about $10,000 each. Maybe I'll win the lottery.
My husband, Mike, is a big Cubs fan, but he's gotten me more into collecting stuff about Lou. We argue over the Cubs and the Yankees all the time. I argue for the Yankees, of course, because of the family.
We have two kids who already carry on the pride of the family name. The eBay stuff is for them to have. Our son, Felix Theodore Mireles III, is 25, married and expecting his first child. He's named after my dad and Grandpa.
My daughter, Amanda, who's 22, has been through a lot in her short life. She's had Hodgkin's lymphoma, avascular necrosis and cancer and has had chemo, radiation and a bone-marrow transplant. Through all that, she went to college and had a son, but he passed away after fighting hard for 13 days. We say that he had Lou's strength to hang on that long. Everyone called him the ''miracle boy.'' It is so amazing to me to watch my child go though all of this and be so very strong. She definitely has the Gehrig courage and talks about using the Gehrig name as a middle name if she has another child.
It may be hard to believe, but I have never been to Yankee Stadium or visited Lou's grave in Valhalla, N.Y. I absolutely hope to do it someday. I'm very proud of the family name. That's one of the reasons why I kept my maiden name. I come from a long line of courageous and humble people. That's why I admire Lou's humility. He was very humble, a great man.
I think of my father that way, and I think of my grandfather that way too. I wish I asked my grandfather more questions about him and Lou when I was growing up.
As you get older, things like that mean a lot more.

''Comedy of Power'' is the name of Claude Chabrol's latest film to be released in the United States, but the phrase could describe much of this director's work. Though his films tend to be witty and ironical rather than laugh-out-loud funny, they often concern themselves with the behavior and misbehavior -- both intimate and public -- of the French ruling classes.
Criminality plays a large role in Mr. Chabrol's view of the world, but rather than moralize, he treats his characters with a wry mixture of sympathy and cynicism. His touch is characteristically light, as if in defiance of the gravity of the stories he has occasion to tell, and his sensibility is aphoristically summed up by one of the characters in ''Comedy of Power,'' who suggests that ''nothing is serious, and everything is tragic.''
"Comedy of Power" is not Claude Chabrol's deepest or most ambitious film, but Isabelle Huppert's ferocity compensates for the director's detachment.

Criminality plays a large role in Mr. Chabrol's view of the world, but rather than moralize, he treats his characters with a wry mixture of sympathy and cynicism. His touch is characteristically light, as if in defiance of the gravity of the stories he has occasion to tell, and his sensibility is aphoristically summed up by one of the characters in ''Comedy of Power,'' who suggests that ''nothing is serious, and everything is tragic.''
This highly arguable observation gains a great deal by being said in French, with a smile, by a good-looking man (the actor is Mr. Chabrol's 43-year-old son, Thomas) who has abandoned the possibility of an important administrative career to become a part-time maker of crossword puzzles.
''Comedy of Power'' takes its inspiration from the Elf Aquitaine scandal of the 1990s, which exposed extensive corruption in France's giant gas company, then state owned. The judge who led the Elf investigation, Eva Joly, is clearly the model for Jeanne Charmant Killman. Played by Isabelle Huppert, who has become something of a fixture in Mr. Chabrol's cinematic universe, Jeanne is both admirable in her dedication and perhaps a little scary in her zeal.
Her first target is Michel Humeau (François Berléand), the director of a large company who never quite recovers from the shock and humiliation of being handcuffed, locked in a cell and otherwise treated like an ordinary criminal. Through his ordeal he repeats the plaintive rhetorical question that arises when influence turns into impotence: ''Don't you know who I am?''
Jeanne knows perfectly well, and in due course this unfortunate bigwig's cronies, connections and superiors arrive, one by one, in her office. Like him, they try to flirt, flatter, threaten and condescend their way out of trouble. Mr. Chabrol's discreet, prying camera takes note of the red filaments threaded into the lapels of their flashy suits -- symbols of their membership in the Legion of Honor. Jeanne has only a cherished pair of red gloves, a token of retail feminine vanity rather than state-sanctioned masculine self-importance.
These chévaliers of the Republic act like made guys in a Hollywood Mafia picture, conspiring over brandy and cigars and resorting to thuggishness when their oily attempts at charm fall short. The nature of their crimes is of less interest to Mr. Chabrol than the forms and protocols that guide their exercise of power, and their attempts to defend their imperiled privileges.
There is some talk of kickbacks and financial schemes, but procedural boilerplate is not really the point. Jeanne is sure that the targets of her investigation are guilty, and we are happy to accept her certainty as a warrant: how could they not be?
But public malfeasance is less the subject of the movie than its premise. It is not really a courtroom drama, or the stirring tale of a crusader against wrong, so much as it is the psychological portrait of an ambitious professional woman in a society still very much dominated by male prerogatives. Jeanne's antagonists, used to pampering mistresses and deceiving wives, try to derail her with displays of chivalry and bald-faced lies as well as threats of violence, which they are too delicate to convey themselves.
The comedy arises in the confrontations between these fat cats and their sparrowlike tormentor, who is both punctilious with regard to legal procedure and capricious in the exercise of authority. ''No smoking in my office,'' she snaps, only to light up herself a few scenes later. At one point the bad guys arrange to have another female judge (Maryline Canto) assigned to the case, hoping for a bureaucratic catfight and forgetting the old feminist chestnut that sisterhood is powerful.
Mr. Chabrol's observations of modern French sexual politics extend beyond Jeanne's office into her home. Her husband (Robin Renucci), who is a doctor (and also the son of a wealthy and powerful family), complains that his colleagues call him ''Monsieur Jeanne Charmant Killman,'' and his wife's highly public, possibly dangerous job soon places their marriage under a heavy strain, which pumps a bit of melodrama into the film's otherwise dry air.
As ever, Mr. Chabrol's style is delicate and precise. ''Comedy of Power'' is not his deepest or most ambitious film, and its stance of knowing resignation in the face of corruption can feel a little glib. But Ms. Huppert's ferocity compensates for the director's detachment; no French actress is as riveting to watch once the gloves come off.
Comedy of Power  Opens today in Manhattan.
Directed by Claude Chabrol; written (in French, with English subtitles) by Odile Barski and Mr. Chabrol; director of photography, Eduardo Serra; edited by Monique Fardoulis; music by Matthieu Chabrol; production designer, Françoise Benoit-Fresco; produced by Patrick Godeau; released by Koch Lorber Films.

IN the raw context of the human condition, of life and survival on this planet, all sports are unnecessary, silly even.
But underwater hockey -- a sport incorporating lead pucks, stout wooden sticks, rubberized gloves, snorkels, face masks and bulbous ear guards -- is in a realm of its own.
Underwater hockey  a sport incorporating lead pucks, stout wooden sticks, rubberized gloves, snorkels, face masks and bulbous ear guards  is in a realm of its own.
IN the raw context of the human condition, of life and survival on this planet, all sports are unnecessary, silly even.
But underwater hockey -- a sport incorporating lead pucks, stout wooden sticks, rubberized gloves, snorkels, face masks and bulbous ear guards -- is in a realm of its own.
Underwater hockey, indeed, is a sport that begs legitimization in even the most innocent passing reference, said Bryna Nielsen, a member of the United States national team. ''No one's ever heard of it,'' she said, ''and when you explain what you do, people just say 'What?' ''
Ms. Nielsen, a 21-year-old student from Amery, Wis., has played since she was a toddler. Her prowess rose during high school, where holding her breath while pushing a three-pound puck across the pool bottom with a foot-long stick became natural. In the last five years Ms. Nielsen has traveled extensively to play in tournaments.
''I love the team aspects, the camaraderie,'' she said of the sport, which is played six to eight feet underwater in a bubbly, muffled silence.
While variations exist, a common match is 30 minutes long and includes six swimmers per team kicking, diving, defending and sucking fast gulps of air through snorkel tubes. The simple premise of the game -- to push the puck into the opposing team's goal -- is complicated by the medium. Underwater, communication is tough. The puck travels just a few feet per swipe, quickly slowed by the water's resistance.
And then there's the whole issue of breathing.
''Good teams have a rhythm, a Zen,'' said Ben Erickson, captain of the Minnesota Loons, a club team in Minneapolis. Mr. Erickson has played underwater hockey almost every week for 25 years. ''You just know or sense where your guys are, up or down or getting a breath.''
A main challenge of the game, Mr. Erickson said, is communication.
Low bubbly grunts and taps of the stick on the bottom of the pool are common devices. Ms. Nielsen screams through her snorkel to get attention, she said.
Lung capacity is important, though holding your breath for long periods of time is not a required skill. Rather, players who consistently swim up and down for the whole match -- alternatively grabbing gulps of air and attacking the puck below -- are most effective. ''The rhythm is all about breathing and then dropping to the bottom; breathing, dropping to the bottom,'' Mr. Erickson said.
Last August, five members of the Minnesota Loons traveled to Sheffield, England, to compete in the two-week-long Underwater Hockey World Championships, where Mr. Erickson's Zen strategies helped the United States take gold in the Men's Masters division.
Underwater hockey -- called just ''hockey'' by its participants -- is played by about 1,000 people in the United States, according to Gregory Appling, a director with the Underwater Society of America, which serves as underwater hockey's governing body. Club teams dot the map, from Sacramento to Sandwich, Mass.
Internationally, the sport is big in Britain, where it was invented in the 1950s by a group of divers looking for an off-season training regimen. New Zealand, Australia, France and South Africa have strong underwater hockey scenes, Mr. Appling said, adding that numbers are on the rise: ''It's a sport you can play competitively into your 50s or 60s, so many of the veterans stick around while new people continue to come try it out.''
A POOL of deep translucent blue framed 12 members of the Minnesota Loons last week at the University of Minnesota's Aquatic Center, where the team met for a scrimmage. The game began at 7:30 p.m. on the dot.
''Sticks up, go!'' a player yelled to start the match, prompting a mad swim to the center of the pool. A pink puck sat undisturbed on the bottom 8 feet down and in the middle of the 75-foot-long pool.
Fins kicked up in unison near the middle, green, red, black and pink rubber wings cresting like whale tails before the teams dove.
Bubbles percolated around the mass.
Then silence.
Players swam in circles, heads looking down. Snorkels poked up quietly. Splashing was minimal.
''All the action is underwater,'' said Karen Nielsen, the team's self-described hockey mom, who was sitting at the edge of the pool. ''They use the JumboTron screen with underwater cameras during important games.''
A lap swimmer from an adjacent pool walked over, toweling himself off. ''Are they looking for a weighted ball?'' he asked, dumbstruck.
But underwater, viewed through a face mask from the sidelines, the game's athleticism was easily seen. Twelve stick-wielding players crowded at a midfield play, bodies twisting, contorting, reaching for the puck. Swimmers dived up and down.
The puck skipped and jumped from stick to stick, moving down the pool toward a 10-foot-wide underwater goal. Bubbles leaked from snorkel tubes, air and energy waning quickly on the bottom of the swimming pool.
Passes and strategies played out. Sticks tapped the tile around the puck in miniature sword fights to gain possession. To distinguish who was who, one team wielded white sticks, and the other black.
''Did you see that move?'' Ms. Nielsen exclaimed, surfacing to talk to her teammates. The opposing team -- the White Sticks -- had tapped in a goal, twisting past Ms. Nielsen and three other swimmers in an offensive dash.
Teams collect between each goal (4-3 is a typical final score for a tournament game), resting, breathing and concocting strategy. ''Our forwards are getting too far away from our backs,'' said Chris Tommaso, a 26-year-old chemical engineer. ''Let's keep to the positions.''
Then at the signal -- ''Sticks up, go!'' -- both sides dived back in, swimming the front crawl to the center of the pool before heading down.
''Let the feeding frenzy begin,'' said a player resting on the pool's edge.
Underwater, the athletes swam and spun in the deep fuzzy blue. Arms stretched for the puck.
Eight feet down, water pressure pushed in on ears and eyes. Players kicked hard, swimming off into the deep, twirling in the fizz of their own alternate universe.
BELOW THE SURFACE
THE sport of underwater hockey has a worldwide following of several thousand participants, including teams in Slovenia, Brazil, Japan, Zimbabwe and 28 other countries.
''The sport provides an outlet for former competitive swimmers and divers,'' said Gregory Appling, a director with the Underwater Society of America.
Teams like the Minnesota Loons, a 25-member club in Minneapolis (www.mnuwh.com), practice once or twice a week all year and travel to tournaments around the country.
About 50 underwater hockey clubs exist in the United States, with teams from Hawaii to New York. Newcomers are welcome at most clubs, Mr. Appling said.
A list of underwater hockey clubs is at www.pucku.org/uwht.

China's growing prosperity and the soaring prices for contemporary Chinese art make it easy to forget that the country first opened its doors to modernization in the late 1970s, when Mao's successor Deng Xiaoping introduced capitalist-oriented market reforms. Deng also removed restrictions on the flow of information in China, which allowed foreign ideas to flourish. Most of this information arrived not via the Internet, of course, but in the form of books.
''Shu: Reinventing Books in Chinese Contemporary Art,'' now at the China Institute, glances back at this period of expansion and its contraction, when the Communist Party clamped down on free expression after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. The exhibition, divided into two parts (the first ran this fall), doesn't break new art historical ground, but it does provide a savvy snapshot of the early-1990s Chinese contemporary-art scene.

China's growing prosperity and the soaring prices for contemporary Chinese art make it easy to forget that the country first opened its doors to modernization in the late 1970s, when Mao's successor Deng Xiaoping introduced capitalist-oriented market reforms. Deng also removed restrictions on the flow of information in China, which allowed foreign ideas to flourish. Most of this information arrived not via the Internet, of course, but in the form of books.
''Shu: Reinventing Books in Chinese Contemporary Art,'' now at the China Institute, glances back at this period of expansion and its contraction, when the Communist Party clamped down on free expression after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. The exhibition, divided into two parts (the first ran this fall), doesn't break new art historical ground, but it does provide a savvy snapshot of the early-1990s Chinese contemporary-art scene.
''Shu,'' meaning book in Chinese, was organized by Wu Hung, an art history professor at the University of Chicago. Dr. Wu specializes in Tang dynasty painting, but his true passion lies with contemporary Chinese art. Unsurprisingly, ''Shu'' focuses on how current Chinese artists bridge the gap between China's literati past and its increasingly capitalist present.
In ''Reimagining Tradition,'' the first installment of ''Shu,'' in the fall, artists put new spins on China's centuries-old artistic traditions. Gu Wenda, for example, displayed modernized versions of scholar's accouterments, including ink made from Mr. Gu's signature material: real Chinese human hair. Xu Bing exhibited the wood blocks he used to print ''Book From the Sky,'' a series of 50-foot-long scrolls first shown in 1988 in Beijing. The calligraphy looks authentic, but can't be read. Mr. Xu made up every single one of its 4,000 characters.
While Mr. Xu's text literally says nothing, it does intimate how hard it was to be an artist in a country that was out of the habit of valuing intellectuals. Now, the second part of ''Shu,'' ''Negotiating History and Memory,'' portrays the anxiety of artists under pressure during the early years of China's emergence.
Life in China during the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), with its public denunciations, forced labor and death by mob violence, was traumatic. But for many Chinese, including the artist Gu Xiong, it was also a time when China was sure of its cultural self.
At 16, Mr. Gu was sent to the countryside for re-education. When he wasn't working in tobacco fields, he created an illustrated diary, on exhibit here under the title ''Cultural Revolution Sketchbooks'' (1972-76). His drawings, all stylistically similar to Cultural Revolution propaganda posters, show no sign of a disgruntled teenager. Instead, they quietly celebrate revolutionary life among comrades.
Chinese cultural life changed dramatically in the 1980s, when literature other than Mao's ''Little Red Book'' surfaced. Qiu Zhijie's photographic ''library,'' which papers the walls of the China Institute's main staircase, makes the extent of this information explosion evident. Among the thousands of titles are Chinese classics, books on natural sciences and treatises by Plato, Disraeli and Harold Bloom, as well as art books on Indian stupa, Japanese manga and Barbara Kruger.
Such a trove might have been considered a treasure before the Tiananmen Square protests; afterward, such resources became sources of angst. The figure that appears throughout Zhang Xiaogang's 1991 series ''Private Notes,'' for example, looks as if he is losing his mind -- and his head, torso and myriad other body parts -- as he struggles to write letters and decode illegible manuscripts. Without easy access to words, the images imply, there can be no such thing as free expression.
In the early 1990s the average Chinese citizen wouldn't have had time to bother with such intellectual problems, as Xiaoze Xie's photorealist painting depicting worm-eaten books left to rot on library shelves suggests.
Yue Minjun's ''Garbage Dump'' (2005-6) highlights how a lack of appreciation for things scholarly caused tension between the educated and the uneducated. Here books are the subject of a bizarre, cavemanlike ritual, as six semi-naked men squat together in a circle on top of piles of books, grinning like village idiots.
''Garbage Dump'' implies that narrow minds, not books, make people stupid. Cai Guo Qiang's contribution, an ink-painted miniature screen that is actually a proposal for a museum project, suggests that fear also creates thought imprisonment, and not only in China.
In 1995, when the Naoshima Museum in Japan commissioned Mr. Cai to create a project, he proposed ''Wako: Japanese Pirates in the Middle Ages.'' His idea involved taking a boat from China to Japan via Taiwan and Korea. When the boat stopped, it would take on board a stone stele carved with that region's dictionary definition of wako. These pirates historically disrupted trade along the ancient silk routes; everyone who came into contact with them (except the Japanese, of course) hated them. Afraid that the project might incite antagonism toward Japan, the museum canceled the show.
Today it is unlikely that Mr. Cai's project would be censored. China has metamorphosed from an isolated, intellectual desert into fertile ground for cultural exchange. It is in this soil, not in the post-Tiananmen world of the early 1990s, where the future of Chinese contemporary art lies. China, after all, now more than ever, is a superpower.
''Shu'' continues through Feb. 24 at the China Institute, 125 East 65th Street, Manhattan; (212) 744-8181 or chinainstitute.org.

263 <html><head><b><center>Counterculture Lion, Back in His Tidy Jungle<center></b></head><p align="left">Author Robert Stone will release Prime Green, long-awaited memoir of 1960s; he comments (M)
''I SUPPOSE the '60s seemed like a big revolution, but to me it always felt a small circle of friends,'' Robert Stone said recently while revisiting his old East Village neighborhood, one of that era's epicenters. ''And by the time of the Summer of Love, in the late '60s, it was over. That was the end of it. Every kid who was on the loose turned up, and it was no longer our thing. It was a fashion.''
Mr. Stone, who is himself an emblematic '60s figure -- perhaps the only member of Ken Kesey's famed Merry Prankster bus trip of 1964 who can still remember what happened -- is 69 now, and he and Janice, his wife of 47 years, recently decided to take a break. No drink or drugs for at least a year, after which, Mr. Stone said, they will ''rethink.'' One bonus of the new regimen, he added, is that he now gets more work done in the evening.
Robert Stone, whose new book is a long-awaited memoir of the ’60s, “Prime Green,” revisited his old East Village neighborhood recently.
''I SUPPOSE the '60s seemed like a big revolution, but to me it always felt a small circle of friends,'' Robert Stone said recently while revisiting his old East Village neighborhood, one of that era's epicenters. ''And by the time of the Summer of Love, in the late '60s, it was over. That was the end of it. Every kid who was on the loose turned up, and it was no longer our thing. It was a fashion.''
Mr. Stone, who is himself an emblematic '60s figure -- perhaps the only member of Ken Kesey's famed Merry Prankster bus trip of 1964 who can still remember what happened -- is 69 now, and he and Janice, his wife of 47 years, recently decided to take a break. No drink or drugs for at least a year, after which, Mr. Stone said, they will ''rethink.'' One bonus of the new regimen, he added, is that he now gets more work done in the evening.
The author of seven novels, including ''Dog Soldiers,'' ''A Flag for Sunrise'' and ''Damascus Gate,'' Mr. Stone has at last finished a long-awaited memoir of the '60s, ''Prime Green,'' which comes out Tuesday. It recounts his history not only with Kesey but with such other counterculture legends as Jack Kerouac, Neal Cassady and Allen Ginsberg; with the pioneering ''acid tests'' in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco (Mr. Stone's first hit was administered by Baba Ram Dass himself); his apprenticeship at a cheesy tabloid where he wrote headlines like ''Mad Dentist Yanks Girl's Tongue,'' and, later, his stints as a war correspondent in Vietnam.
But as the book makes clear, Mr. Stone's '60s were in large part an outgrowth of the Beat culture of the 1950s, and Mr. Stone, who grew up in S.R.O. hotels on the West Side and now lives on the Upper East Side, recently spent a couple of hours wandering around the East Village, where he lived and hung out in those days. For a while he even had a paper route there. ''It was almost a different country back then: you couldn't understand people from other parts, and they couldn't understand you,'' he said in a voice that still has echoes of an old-fashioned streetwise New York accent. ''The culture wasn't so homogeneous. When I was in the service in the '50s, I remember, they served pizza once, and some of the guys put ice cream on it because they thought it was pie.''
First stop: 13 St. Marks Place. ''That's where we were on New Year's Eve, 1959,'' Mr. Stone said, pointing to an upstairs apartment. ''My wife and I and our first child. Of course the neighborhood wasn't fixed up then: it was really an extension of the Bowery. When my wife or I used to go shopping, we used to have a choice about what to bring upstairs first, the groceries or the kid. I always figured there was more chance of the food being stolen, so I'd give some derelict a dime and ask him to watch the baby.''
Across the street he pointed out a brownstone building with a carved sign indicating that it was the Deutsche-Amerikanische Schützen Gesellschaft, or German-American Shooting School: a relic, he said, of the days when the neighborhood was a German one. ''It was the General Slocum disaster that pretty much ended that,'' he said, referring to a 1904 steamship explosion in the East River that left more than 1,000 dead, many of them residents of the old German-American neighborhood that became the East Village.
Mr. Stone paused for a minute, looking around, and said: ''You know, the biggest change is that all these buildings have been cleaned. It all looks so different. When I lived here, everything was a plain, somber gray. In winter especially, I really liked the grayness, the severity, of it all. The grimness.''
Other landmarks on the block include W. H. Auden's building, farther along, at No. 77 St. Marks Place, and closer to the middle of the block the site of the Polski Dom, or Polish Home, a favorite spot for Gypsy weddings, which Andy Warhol turned into the Electric Circus nightclub of the late '60s.
''I never really got the Warhol thing,'' Mr. Stone said. ''Back then the concept of bohemia wasn't a mass phenomenon. We still thought of it as kind of a coterie thing, and we were a little snobbish. When we started doing the drugs -- peyote and smoking dope -- it was part of the Beat scene. Dope wasn't being done everywhere, and we felt kind of proprietary about it. And when it started spreading in the '60s, it was like going to a party and having it spill out the door.''
Around the corner, on East Fourth Street, was an earlier apartment of the Stones, in a building called the Garden of Eden. But the sign is gone now, and Mr. Stone was no longer sure where the entrance was.
''I used to think of this as kind of an elegant block,'' he said. ''But it doesn't look that way now.'' He pointed to a little playground across the street.
''That's where the Jets used to hang out,'' he said. ''They didn't call themselves that, but that's what they were, a gang.'' He smiled and added that while growing up in New York he had briefly been a junior member of a gang called the Saxons. ''But we didn't have guns,'' he said. ''We had rock fights in Central Park.''
In the course of the afternoon a lot of bars and clubs were invoked, a litany of classic New York watering holes: Bradley's, the Cedar Tavern, the Lion's Head, McSorley's Old Ale House (where, Mr. Stone recalled, they used to lock the door on New Year's Eve and let the remaining customers finish off the kegs free), the 55 (for a while a druggies' haunt, where Janice Stone once saw three men overdose on methadone) and the Figaro, at Bleecker and Macdougal Streets, where Robert and Janice Stone first met.
''Every young woman in black stockings worked at the Figaro back then,'' he said. ''During the day Janice worked as a guidette at the RCA Building, so in the evening she'd have to take off her uniform and then put on the other uniform -- the black stockings.''
There was also a bar on East Sixth Street where Mr. Stone used to buy peyote buttons imported from a cactus ranch in Texas. ''It was a place run by a guy named the Baron,'' he said. ''He was a follower of Ayn Rand, so the only sign out front was a big dollar sign.''
Mr. Stone recalled that he would sometimes stop off at the Baron's on his way to The Daily News, where he worked for a while, writing sports captions and occasionally covering professional wrestling. And he added, though it probably goes without saying, ''The wrestling matches were pretty weird on peyote.''
Heading toward Astor Place, he discovered that one of his favorite coffee shops had been turned into a Starbucks. Stopping for a light, he said, with less sadness than surprise: ''I used to have such a tremendous sense of the city and of this neighborhood, and it's lost to me now. It's so far away I can't even miss it. So many places I attached myself to, and I can't even feel it anymore. It's beyond nostalgia, beyond reclaim.''
Robert Stone's Village
Correction:  January 11, 2007, Thursday  Because of an editing error, an article in Weekend on Friday about a walk in the East Village with Robert Stone, who has a new memoir about the 1960s, ''Prime Green,'' misstated the history of Andy Warhol's connection with the Polski Dom, or Polish Home, on St. Marks Place. The nightclub Warhol opened there, in 1966, was called Dom, not the Electric Circus. (The Electric Circus, not run by Warhol, opened at the site in 1967.)
A map with the article omitted identification of one street and misidentified two others. The unidentified street north of St. Marks Place is East Ninth Street; the two streets north of that are East 10th and East 11th -- not East Ninth and East 10th.
The map also included an imprecise translation of the German name Deutsche-Amerikanische Schützen Gesellschaft, engraved on the building at 12 St. Marks Place, built in 1885. The ''German-American Shooting Club'' is a more precise translation and description of the organization's function in the community than ''German-American Shooting School.''

EVERYONE knows that Russian winters are brutal. Perhaps that's why, as anyone who knows Russian culture can attest, the winter season is also famous for fun -- a festive time for Russians to stave off cold-weather blues.
Although Russians officially switched to the Gregorian calendar after the revolution of 1917, the Russian Orthodox Church has maintained its holiday schedule using the Julian calendar, meaning Christmas is celebrated on the day the Gregorian calendar calls Jan. 7 and New Year on Jan. 14.
Russian winter festivals from London to Oregon stave off cold-weather blues with festive food, dancing and music.
EVERYONE knows that Russian winters are brutal. Perhaps that's why, as anyone who knows Russian culture can attest, the winter season is also famous for fun -- a festive time for Russians to stave off cold-weather blues.
Although Russians officially switched to the Gregorian calendar after the revolution of 1917, the Russian Orthodox Church has maintained its holiday schedule using the Julian calendar, meaning Christmas is celebrated on the day the Gregorian calendar calls Jan. 7 and New Year on Jan. 14.
Christmas is mostly a family affair, but come New Year, it's party time. A few weeks later comes the traditional celebration of Maslenitsa, a last-chance party before Lent, like Mardis Gras or Carnival. And because Russians seem to find their holidays too good to leave behind, even if you can't make it all the way to Russia this winter, you can find opportunities to join the celebration.
London, for example, will hold the third Russian Winter Festival this year on Jan. 13, the eve of Orthodox New Year, in Trafalgar Square. And on Feb. 9 in New York, just before Maslenitsa (Feb. 12 to 18 this year), the Russian Children's Welfare Society will hold the 42nd Petroushka Ball. It's a traditional Russian ball, with fine dining, dancing and music at the Waldorf-Astoria. Originally a small, invitation-only charity benefit, the ball, though still formal and rather expensive, is now open to anyone who wants to buy a ticket.
In San Francisco, the Russian Center sponsors a less formal but more open winter festival, now in its 19th year. It's roughly scheduled to coincide with Maslenitsa in Russia, where the tradition is for people to take to the streets in brightly colored costumes and masks for bonfires and effigy burnings, sanctioned group fistfights and other alcohol-fueled merriment. Everyone eats the traditional Maslenitsa food: blintzes with butter, jam, caviar and other toppings. Organizers in San Francisco expect to have everything but the fighting for their three-day event, which usually draws about 4,000 people.
''Maslenitsa actually means something having to do with butter,'' said Zoia Choglokoff, and vice president and director of programs at the center (the Russian word for butter is maslo). ''It means you can have blintzes and butter and drink and so on, and then for six weeks you have to stop it,'' she said. ''It's an old Russian tradition.''
The Slavic Festival this weekend in Eugene, Ore., though not exclusively Russian, is held in conjunction with the Russian holidays and features traditional food, dancing, music and art that is mostly Russian. It is sponsored by the Slavic Home, a nonprofit cultural organization.
Of course, one of the most recognizable elements of Russia's culture is its rich legacy of symphonic music. The New Jersey Symphony Orchestra is taking Russian culture on the road this winter with its Russian Romantics Festival, beginning next week. In a series of concerts around the state, the orchestra will feature the music of Rachmaninoff, Tchaikovsky, Borodin and other Russian composers.
Also holding a Russian winter festival is the Tucson Symphony Orchestra: four concerts will feature the music of Prokofiev, Mussorgsky and Shostakovich, among others. George Hanson, the symphony's music director and conductor, has long had an interest in Russian music.
Mr. Hanson, who won an ECHO-Klassik award in 2003 in Germany for recordings of works by Anton Rubinstein, finds a passion in Russian music that may be echoed in the enthusiasm the country shows for its holidays. ''When a Russian plays the violin, you never have to wonder if it's a Russian,'' he said. ''They dig in. The hairs on the bow start flying onto the floor. A great performance of a Russian work will draw you into a world where the colors are more vivid and the emotions are more keenly felt.''

A hand grenade was tossed into a government army compound on Thursday night in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital, in yet another sign of growing chaos in the country.
Just days after Ethiopian-led troops helped rout once powerful Islamist forces in Somalia and install a new government in the capital, security seemed to be unraveling across the country.
Security seemed to be unraveling as antigovernment attacks and increased banditry were fueling growing chaos in the country.
A hand grenade was tossed into a government army compound on Thursday night in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital, in yet another sign of growing chaos in the country.
Just days after Ethiopian-led troops helped rout once powerful Islamist forces in Somalia and install a new government in the capital, security seemed to be unraveling across the country.
The violence is surging on two fronts: antigovernment attacks and increased banditry, both of which were virtually unheard of during the Islamists' short-lived reign.
Witnesses said that shortly after nightfall, a man in a pickup truck flung a grenade over a wall and into a compound that housed Ethiopian and government soldiers. Apparently, no one was seriously hurt and the pickup truck escaped in a blaze of gunfire.
In northern Mogadishu, residents said that four people were killed Wednesday night after bandits fired a bazooka at a truck whose driver refused to pay an extortion tax. Unauthorized checkpoints have popped up all over the city, reminiscent of the years of anarchy when clan-based militias carved up Mogadishu -- and much of the rest of Somalia, for that matter.
In Dhagtur, in central Somalia, Shabelle radio reported Thursday that five people, including two children, were killed by a tribal militia during a gun battle. A dispute over a well was cited as the possible cause.
But despite the worsening violence, Somalia's transitional government is moving to consolidate its tenuous grip on power. On Thursday, Ali Mohammed Gedi, the veterinarian who is now prime minister, appointed more than 30 new judges, including two women.
''Quite soon, the police stations in Mogadishu will be operational,'' Mr. Gedi said. ''If a criminal is arrested, the police will have the access to put the criminal on trial.''
Since Somalia's central government collapsed in 1991, the wheels of justice have rusted over, leaving few functioning police stations, jails or courts.
Mr. Gedi also pushed ahead with his disarmament plan, extending until Saturday a deadline for turning in guns and threatening house-to-house searches if the guns were not surrendered.
In Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, the president of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, announced Thursday that Uganda was ready to volunteer a battalion of around 800 soldiers to serve as peacekeepers in Somalia. The African Union is trying to cobble together a peacekeeping force to take the place of Ethiopian troops and lend much-needed muscle to the transitional government.
The transitional government is still battling the last remnants of the Islamist forces, who have fled to a remote, heavily forested area in southern Somalia along the Kenyan border. Somali officials said that several hundred Islamist fighters were cornered, and that it was only a matter of days until the Islamist movement, which had ruled much of Somalia for the past six months until Ethiopian forces intervened, was finished for good.

Turkmenistan's acting president, Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov, who had promised only continuity with the severely authoritarian policies of his predecessor, on Thursday proposed measures that would help lift the nation from its fortresslike isolation.
Mr. Berdymukhammedov promised a laundry list of changes affecting agriculture, social assistance programs, education and the economy. The proposals, outlined in a speech in Ashgabat, the capital, included giving students access to foreign universities -- including those in the United States -- sending doctors to Western hospitals to acquire modern skills and extending primary schooling to 10 years. Mr. Berdymukhammedov also vowed to create a culture of entrepreneurship, suggesting that he would encourage private ownership of some residences and businesses. Almost all economic activity in Turkmenistan is tied to the government.

The proposals, outlined in a speech in Ashgabat, the capital, included giving students access to foreign universities -- including those in the United States -- sending doctors to Western hospitals to acquire modern skills and extending primary schooling to 10 years. Mr. Berdymukhammedov also vowed to create a culture of entrepreneurship, suggesting that he would encourage private ownership of some residences and businesses. Almost all economic activity in Turkmenistan is tied to the government.
He also promised to allow universal access to the Internet. Turkmens are allowed almost no contact with the outside world. In recent years, even foreign newspapers and cable television from Russia were prohibited under the mercurial rule of Saparmurat Niyazov, the ''president for life,'' who died on Dec. 21. Simply receiving a telephone call originating in a foreign country can arouse the interest of Turkmenistan's feared security apparatus, said Turkmens who had spoken to journalists.
Mr. Berdymukhammedov's public comments underscored the fluidity of the nation's opaque politics as it prepares for a presidential election on Feb. 11, foreign analysts said.
''I think there is a much more deeply rooted struggle for power in Turkmenistan than we originally thought,'' said Martha Brill Olcott, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, in a telephone interview.
As acting president, Mr. Berdymukhammedov, a former deputy prime minister, was prohibited by the Constitution from seeking the presidency. But the national legislature simply changed the rules to allow him to run and then approved a slate of colorless, midlevel bureaucrats and politicians as false opposition candidates.
But Mr. Berdymukhammedov may fear that such tactics are backfiring, Dr. Olcott said, strengthening the opposition in exile and increasing the chances that his opponents will gain support from Western governments.
''Berdymukhammedov is seeking ways to appease the foreign community in order to get support for a very nondemocratic constitution modified in a very nondemocratic way, and to validate an election in which the electoral process was flawed from the beginning,'' she said.
The government trumpets its policy of geopolitical neutrality, but Turkmenistan's dependence on customers for its enormous natural gas deposits has given outside powers, especially Russia, Europe and the United States, significant influence.
But few signs of outside pressure have been seen.
The ''Turkmenistan government is going to have to moderate their own political process,'' Sean McCormack, the State Department spokesman, said Wednesday, when asked by reporters how the United States would respond to recent lobbying from Turkmen opposition figures for support of the country's exiled political opposition.
In his speech, Mr. Berdymukhammedov also promised to double state pensions, student stipends and government salaries, to build resorts on the Caspian Sea and to continue Mr. Niyazov's popular program of distributing water, salt and gasoline free.

Pakistan's prime minister, Shaukat Aziz, said Thursday that he wanted the three million Afghan refugees still living in Pakistan to go home as one way to end the problem of insurgents using the country as a haven.
It is the first time Pakistan has been so blunt in demanding that the Afghans, to whom it has served as host for more than 20 years since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, leave.
Shaukat Aziz said he wanted three million Afghan refugees to go home to end the problem of insurgents using Pakistan as a haven.
Pakistan's prime minister, Shaukat Aziz, said Thursday that he wanted the three million Afghan refugees still living in Pakistan to go home as one way to end the problem of insurgents using the country as a haven.
It is the first time Pakistan has been so blunt in demanding that the Afghans, to whom it has served as host for more than 20 years since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, leave.
Mr. Aziz arrived here for talks with the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, in an effort to smooth tensions between the neighbors, but after more than two hours Mr. Karzai acknowledged that relations were only growing worse.
''Unfortunately, the gulf in relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan is getting wider, and it is not getting narrower,'' Mr. Karzai said after their meeting.
The two leaders emerged with no agreement on the main areas of contention, namely Pakistan's plan to fence and mine the border, and Afghanistan's project to convene two tribal gatherings, or jirgas, of national representatives from both countries, to try to foster peace between the countries.
Shortly before the meeting, Pakistan announced that it was going ahead with a plan to fence and mine the long mountainous border. Afghanistan has repeatedly condemned the project as a diversion from the real problem of terrorism, which it says is being incubated in Pakistan. Pakistan has also dragged its feet on organizing the tribal gatherings, promising only to form a commission to work on the idea.
''The Afghan people want to remove all those obstacles which create the divide in our relations,'' Mr. Karzai said. ''Those obstacles are created by terrorist activities which are hindering Afghanistan's reconstruction and making our schools burn.
''Security will not come to Afghanistan unless together we and Pakistan, with good and friendly relations, become tough in the fight against terrorism,'' he added. He said he wanted to hold the tribal jirgas so people could speak their minds.
Without offering specifics, Mr. Aziz said the two leaders agreed to work on resettling three million Afghan refugees back in Afghanistan and removing the sanctuary that refugee camps provide to insurgents.
''Refugee camps on our side of the border sometimes are safe havens for elements who are from Afghanistan and take safe haven there after conducting activities,'' he said.
He also defended Pakistan's plan to fence and mine the border as one way to restrict the movement of people who represent a threat to security. ''We believe that selective fencing and mining can help achieve the objective,'' he said, adding that the fence and mines would not prevent the ordinary crossing of local tribes.

When complaints emerged in 2004 over the sale of a creationist account of the formation of the Grand Canyon in National Park Service bookstores, Interior Department officials said they would review whether the book should be pulled from the shelves.
But there was no formal review, in part because of differences of opinion among the Park Service's own specialists, said David Barna, a spokesman for the agency, in an interview yesterday.
The book offers a creationist account of the formation of the Grand Canyon.
When complaints emerged in 2004 over the sale of a creationist account of the formation of the Grand Canyon in National Park Service bookstores, Interior Department officials said they would review whether the book should be pulled from the shelves.
But there was no formal review, in part because of differences of opinion among the Park Service's own specialists, said David Barna, a spokesman for the agency, in an interview yesterday.
When officials got together to discuss the book, the geologists and natural resource specialists would say, ''Get this book out of here,'' Mr. Barna said. ''But the education and interpretation people would say: 'Wait a minute. If your science is so sound, the fact that there are differences of opinion should not scare you away.' ''
In the end, no formal action was taken, and the book remains on sale because, Mr. Barna said in a written statement, ''It is not our role to tell people what to believe.''
The Park Service issued the statement after an organization of state and federal natural resource managers, Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, or PEER, said it had filed a Freedom of Information Act request concerning the agency's handling of the book, ''Grand Canyon: A Different View.''
The group received a letter saying a review of records ''did not locate any documents responsive to your request,'' which Mr. Barna confirmed, saying ''there's no real record.''
Jeff Ruch, executive director of PEER, said the Park Service was advancing a particular religious view by keeping the book on sale, and was also deceiving people about it, by repeatedly saying that it would be reviewed.
''If the question is religious values, they ought at least to be honest about it,'' Mr. Ruch said.
The book was assembled by Tom Vail, who operates Canyon Ministries, which offers canyon river tours with a creationist bent.
The book maintains that the heavens and the earth were created in six days about 6,000 years ago and that the canyon was formed in a divine flood sent to wipe out ''the wickedness of man.''
Scientists say that earth is billions of years old and that the canyon has been carved over millions of years by the action of the Colorado River.
In his statement, Mr. Barna notes that Park Service management policies require reliance on ''the best scientific evidence available'' and, as a result, rangers tell visitors that ''the Colorado River basin has developed in the past 40 million years.''
But the guidelines also say that material available from concessionaires in national parks should adhere to the standards used to evaluate Park Service materials.
When the book appeared on Park Service store shelves, there were objections from a host of scientists, including the agency's own geologists, who said it ''repudiates science.''
In the interview, Mr. Barna said a new interpretive center would open at the canyon this summer, offering a more detailed explanation of the canyon's development, told in scientific, not religious, terms. He said this investment in science shows where the agency stands.
But in an interview yesterday, Mr. Ruch said selling the book was one of a number of efforts to promote the views of fundamentalist Christians in the park, ''not Buddhists or Muslims or anyone else.''
''This is government establishment of religion in a fairly fundamental way, if you pardon the pun,'' Mr. Ruch said.

More than 20,000 Rhode Island students were told Thursday to stay home from school at least until Monday as officials investigate the case of a student hospitalized Wednesday with meningitis.
The officials are trying to determine whether that case is related to an encephalitis outbreak last month in which a second grader from Warwick died.
Officials are trying to determine whether the case of a student hospitalized with meningitis is related to an encephalitis outbreak last month.
More than 20,000 Rhode Island students were told Thursday to stay home from school at least until Monday as officials investigate the case of a student hospitalized Wednesday with meningitis.
The officials are trying to determine whether that case is related to an encephalitis outbreak last month in which a second grader from Warwick died.
Schools in Coventry, Warwick and West Warwick were closed early Thursday after officials learned that a student at Hopkins Hill Elementary School here had meningitis. The child is recovering and was expected to be released from the hospital quickly, officials said.
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence closed eight schools in those communities, and Warwick canceled youth activities for Thursday and Friday.
''Due to similarities with the three other children who had encephalitis, we wanted to take an abundance of caution and recommend the closing of schools while we collect additional information,'' said Dr. David R. Gifford, the state's director of health.
Officials are investigating whether the illness was caused by mycoplasma, a common bacteria known as walking pneumonia.
Officials said three prior cases of encephalitis, which causes brain swelling and is usually caused by a virus, were rare because they were set off by mycoplasma. One of the three students also had meningitis, officials said.
Coventry, Warwick and West Warwick are the Rhode Island communities affected. Officials said they have had high rates of children with pneumonia since October. Investigators are looking at links between increased absenteeism and the encephalitis cases in Warwick and West Warwick.
''We had 20 to 24 cases in one school and 30 in another,'' said the Coventry school superintendent, Kenneth DiPietro.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is looking into a number of causes, including whether a new or virulent strain of mycoplasma has developed, said Dr. Gifford of the state Health Department.
Connecticut and Massachusetts have sent epidemiologists to assist in the investigation. Neither state has reported similar cases.
School districts throughout Rhode Island are sending letters and e-mail messages home to parents, urging parents and custodians to keep sick children home and listing preventative measures like hand washing and coughing into the elbow, not the hand.
The Health Department is asking school nurses to report students with pneumonia immediately, and custodians are washing desks and telephones.
Pediatricians' offices are swamped with calls.
''We're asking parents to report students who have had strep or pneumonia, to better know if there are any patterns or clusters,'' said Rosemarie K. Kraeger, school superintendent in Middletown.
That district surveyed its nurses this week for such cases, Ms. Kraeger said.
Gov. Donald L. Carcieri said he planned an executive order requiring all elementary schools to distribute gel hand sanitizers. The order will include broader measures that are being formulated, Mr. Carcieri said.
The governor and Dr. Gifford sought to allay fears at a news conference on Thursday afternoon, assuring the parents that the virus is spread just through coughing and saliva and did not survive well outside the body.
''Being with someone for a short period of time in an elevator, sporting event, dinner party or playing after school is not how it's transmitted,'' Dr. Gifford said. ''It doesn't live in air-conditioning ducts.''
Parents in Coventry said they were glad that the state was taking extra precautions and closing school.
''I'm glad they're closed down, so it doesn't spread around,'' said Beverly Baron, whose son Robert is in the eighth grade at Knotty Oak Middle School.
Ms. Baron said she learned of the closing by e-mail.
''It's enough to scare you,'' she said.
Cindy Naro, 41, who lives next door to Ms. Baron with her sons Christopher, 12, and Nicholas, 9, stayed home from her job-training program to care for her children.
Ms. Naro said she did not know that school was closed until Christopher's bus did not arrive. Ms. Naro said she was worried because Nicholas attends Hopkins Hill and tends to become sick easily, although he has been feeling fine.
''I told him, 'I don't care if your baby toe hurts, I need to know,' '' Ms. Naro said. ''I have two kids in two different schools. How far is it going to go?''

A 10-year-old boy hanged himself accidentally on New Year's Eve after watching reports of Saddam Hussein's execution, the police and relatives said Thursday.
Family members discovered the body of the boy, Sergio Pelico, hanging from his bunk bed and called the police in Webster, between Houston and Galveston.
The boy watched television reports about Saddam Hussein’s execution and asked about it, said an uncle.
A 10-year-old boy hanged himself accidentally on New Year's Eve after watching reports of Saddam Hussein's execution, the police and relatives said Thursday.
Family members discovered the body of the boy, Sergio Pelico, hanging from his bunk bed and called the police in Webster, between Houston and Galveston.
The boy watched television reports on Saturday and asked about the execution, said an uncle, Adolfo Chavez.
''He asked, 'Is this how they killed people?' '' Mr. Chavez recounted in Spanish. ''We said, 'No, but they did it to this man because he's bad.' ''
Mr. Chavez said his nephew had said nothing more about the hanging.
The next night, as adults prepared supper and his cousins played, Sergio went upstairs to his bedroom. Another child found the body, Mr. Chavez said.
Capt. Thomas Claunch of the Webster police said there was no reason to suspect suicide.
''It was nothing more than a tragic accident,'' Captain Claunch said. ''I think he was trying to mimic the behavior, and it got out of hand. There were no indications of depression, no problems within the home. He was very positive.''
The captain said Sergio, an only child who was in the fifth grade, had given his mother a belated Christmas card. ''In it,'' Captain Claunch said, ''he says he will do better in school this year, that he wants to get her a better Christmas present next year.''
Captain Claunch said that the authorities were awaiting autopsy results but that he believed the death would be ruled accidental.
Mr. Chavez said the family would ship the boy's body home to Guatemala for burial.

Dr. Leandro Lozada was the kind of pediatrician parents adored. Five days a week, he would leave his comfortable neighborhood here and travel to his private medical practice in a poor section of the Bronx, where he sometimes treated people who had no insurance and occasionally handed out free medication.
''If I had an emergency at 3 a.m., I would call him and he would meet me in the emergency room,'' said Jacqueline Caceres, whose two children were patients of Dr. Lozada's.
YONKERS, Jan. 4  Dr. Leandro Lozada was the kind of pediatrician parents adored. Five days a week, he would leave his comfortable neighborhood here and travel to his private medical practice in a poor section of the Bronx, where he sometimes treated people who had no insurance and occasionally handed out free medication.
Dr. Leandro Lozada was the kind of pediatrician parents adored. Five days a week, he would leave his comfortable neighborhood here and travel to his private medical practice in a poor section of the Bronx, where he sometimes treated people who had no insurance and occasionally handed out free medication.
''If I had an emergency at 3 a.m., I would call him and he would meet me in the emergency room,'' said Jacqueline Caceres, whose two children were patients of Dr. Lozada's.
On Thursday, Ms. Caceres was one of dozens of parents who stopped by Dr. Lozada's practice to set up a memorial and to grieve.
After he failed to show up at his office on Wednesday, Dr. Lozada, 46, was found dead in his ranch-style home here on the border of Scarsdale a few miles from his practice. The police said they found him lying on the bedroom floor, shot at point-blank range several times, including at least once in the face and once in the back of his head. No murder weapon was found.
Edmund Hartnett, the Yonkers police commissioner, said on Thursday that there were no signs of a forced entry or of a struggle, leading him to believe that Dr. Lozada knew his killer. Mr. Hartnett said that detectives were also investigating the possibility that a roll of cash had been taken and reports that a sport utility vehicle had been parked in his driveway on Wednesday.
But no clear motive has surfaced.
''We are looking at his business dealings, his financial records and anyone who might benefit from his death,'' Mr. Hartnett said. ''This was not a random act. This individual appeared to be targeted for this crime.''
According to the police, Dr. Lozada spent much of his time at his practice, Hispanic Pediatrics, where he treated poor patients. He had a former wife and two children, a son and a daughter, who lived nearby and a companion who stayed with him occasionally. So far, the police said they had no primary suspect.
Dr. Lozada, a native of the Dominican Republic, earned his medical degree at the University of Santo Domingo about 20 years ago and came to the United States a short time later. About a decade ago, he set up a practice in the Fordham section of the Bronx in a small brick building on a blighted block. Hoping to brighten the street and the building, at 229 East Kingsbridge Road, he painted the facade of the building blue. Parents said he was known for his skill with children and for his commitment to the neighborhood.
''He was not only a medical doctor, he was a kind-hearted person who cared about where he worked,'' said Christine Reeves, whose grandchildren were patients of Dr. Lozada's.
In a personal statement he wrote for his State Department of Health profile, Dr. Lozada said that his goal was to ''give something back to society by serving my community, which is in need of good and culturally sensitive medical care.''
But residents of the affluent neighborhood in Yonkers where Dr. Lozada had lived in a rented three-bedroom house for the past year said that he made far less of an impression on them. Steven Seligman, whose house backs up to Dr. Lozada's, said he had met his neighbor only when he moved in.
''He was neither friendly nor unfriendly,'' Mr. Seligman said.
Dr. Lozada had a daily schedule that he stuck to closely, Mr. Hartnett said. On Wednesday morning, the police said his day began like most others: He awoke early, picked up his daughter at her mother's home, dropped her off at school and then went to his gym.
When he did not show up at work by 10 a.m., his colleagues grew concerned and called his companion. She told the police that she went to the house just before 3 p.m. and found his body.
On Thursday, a stream of parents and children paused in front of Dr. Lozada's practice. Mourners cried, lighted white prayer candles, wrote messages in Spanish and English on two posters taped to the brick building, and remembered a doctor they called a caregiver and friend.
Hilaria Pena signed the name of her 4-year-old son, Joshua, on a poster that pictured Dr. Lozada as many patients remembered him: smiling, in white shirtsleeves with a stethoscope slung around his neck and a child in his arms.
''He was just a good doctor,'' Ms. Pena said.

The president of the New Jersey State Senate on Thursday proposed a ban on all gifts to lawmakers as part of a sweeping package of bills intended to stiffen penalties for ethics violations.
The Senate president, Richard J. Codey, said he also planned to introduce measures that would ban political contributions by public entities, step up ethics training for lawmakers and their aides and provide full disclosure for expenditures that are added to the state's budget at the last minute.
TRENTON, Jan. 4  The president of the New Jersey State Senate on Thursday proposed a ban on all gifts to lawmakers as part of a sweeping package of bills intended to stiffen penalties for ethics violations.
The president of the New Jersey State Senate on Thursday proposed a ban on all gifts to lawmakers as part of a sweeping package of bills intended to stiffen penalties for ethics violations.
The Senate president, Richard J. Codey, said he also planned to introduce measures that would ban political contributions by public entities, step up ethics training for lawmakers and their aides and provide full disclosure for expenditures that are added to the state's budget at the last minute.
Mr. Codey said the measures, which he hoped would pass by the end of the legislative session on July 1, would bolster public confidence in elected officials in a state that has seen more than 200 federal corruption convictions in the past five years.
''There are certain things we can do,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''We've got to make sure that we're up to speed on these progressive measures.''
Mr. Codey said he did not expect resistance to the measures, largely because each of the 120 seats in the State Legislature is up for election in November and lawmakers will be reluctant to appear soft on public corruption in a state weary of scandal.
Of the seven bills proposed by Mr. Codey on Thursday, the two most significant concern the acceptance of gifts by lawmakers and increased transparency in the state's budget process. Currently, legislators and their staff members are allowed to accept gifts valued up to $250. Mr. Codey is seeking a complete prohibition on gifts.
Mr. Codey said his proposal for advance notification about 11th-hour budget additions would require lawmakers to submit a written request for changes to the governor's proposed budget 10 to 14 days before the Legislature considers the budget bill.
Several lawmakers called for such a measure last year when more than a quarter billion dollars in expenditures for pet projects were added to the $31 billion budget only hours before it was voted on.
Before approving the budget, which ended a seven-day shutdown of state government, Gov. Jon S. Corzine cut more than $51 million of those last-minute additions.
''Senate President Codey should certainly be commended,'' Mr. Corzine's spokesman, Anthony Coley, said on Thursday. ''He has a partner in Governor Corzine on this.''
Assembly Speaker Joseph J. Roberts Jr. also pledged his support and said he hoped the measures would ''help dispel some of the public's skepticism and cynicism about government.''
Assemblyman Alex DeCroce, the leader of the Republican minority in the Assembly, said many of the proposals mirrored ideas already submitted by Republicans in recent months. ''I hope Senate President Codey will also consider these ideas,'' Mr. DeCroce said.

''I'm O.K.! I'm O.K.,'' Shenay Acheampong, 3, insisted, her little voice slightly croaky from a cold.
Shenay was born with osteogenesis imperfecta Type III, a genetic condition commonly called brittle bone disease.
''I'm O.K.! I'm O.K.,'' Shenay Acheampong, 3, insisted, her little voice slightly croaky from a cold.
Shenay was born with osteogenesis imperfecta Type III, a genetic condition commonly called brittle bone disease.
''She's very fragile,'' said her mother, Dorcas Acheampong, 28. ''She break easily.'' Shenay is small, with short arms and legs. For her, the most mundane movement is risky; pulling off a snug shirt can snap a bone. Shenay has spent much of her young life in hospitals, where blood pressure cuffs, X-ray procedures and intravenous insertions have all caused breaks and fractures.
''Any time she goes to the hospital, we have to put a note in her crib,'' said Ms. Acheampong, who estimates that Shenay has worn 50 casts in her 3 years.
Shenay's delicate bones impose a severe limitation on her lively mind. She spends most of her days lying down, too weak to sit up for more than an hour. She looks up at the world with big, bright eyes. "Mentally, everything is O.K., her head, brain and everything," her mother said, and Shenay emphatically agreed.
''She always needs somebody to talk with because she likes to talk,'' Ms. Acheampong said.
''She has lots of opinions,'' added Keiko Aizawa, a social worker at New Alternatives for Children Inc. a preventive program that serves families with medically fragile children, including Ms. Acheampong and Shenay. The program is run by the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
Mother and daughter have spent a lot of time in hospitals. Treating Shenay's disease requires calcium infusions every three months. As an infant, it took her a month or more to recover from the infusions. Now it requires a three-day stay at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan.
When Shenay was 7 months old, in October 2003, she had brain surgery, and a shunt was inserted to allow fluid to drain. After the surgery, she had difficulty swallowing and was fed through a tube in her nose for two years, until last October, when a feeding tube was inserted in her stomach, which she prefers.
''It's hiding, so it's O.K.,'' her mother said. ''She didn't want people to ask questions about the tube.''
Ms. Acheampong was unable to work while caring for Shenay during her preparation for surgery to insert the new feeding tube and then her recovery from it. She fell behind on rent. Neediest Cases was able to help. Ms. Acheampong's monthly rent is $648 for her one-bedroom apartment in the Bronx. She receives $606 in Supplemental Security Income for Shenay each month, and $140 in food stamps. Shenay's medical costs are covered by Medicaid. Ms. Aizawa put $300 of Neediest Cases money toward Ms. Acheampong's rent for December.
Ms. Acheampong had worked as a home health aide and is eager to return to work when her daughter's health allows. ''I had more experience taking care of her. So I can take any case they give me,'' she said.
Shenay is busy learning new things. She practices eating. ''She's trying to feed herself, but she can't do it like a normal baby,'' Ms. Acheampong said. ''She's weak.'' Twice a week Shenay has therapy: speech, physical, occupational and feeding.
At the end of November Shenay got a back and leg brace, which Ms. Acheampong and the doctors hope will give her the strength to stand and perhaps someday to walk. ''Right now they just want to start standing her up,'' Ms. Acheampong said.
Shenay started school in the fall at St. Mary's Hospital for Children in Queens, which provides grade level work and access to medical care. She gets there on a school bus three days a week. Even school at a hospital can be hurtful. ''They want me to bring big clothes if I'm bringing her to St. Mary,'' Ms. Acheampong said, so the staff can change Shenay without injuring her.
Ms. Aizawa said that, at New Alternatives, Shenay and her mother have found help and a role model: a 20-year-old woman with the same disease who grew up in the program. ''She goes to Hunter College,'' Ms. Acheampong said. ''She lives in her own apartment. She's in a wheelchair, and she needs lots of help, but she is a very bright woman with a great talent for art.''
Ms. Acheampong said that she and the Hunter College student talk on the phone ''all the time.'' Ms. Acheampong is hopeful that Shenay will be independent. ''I'm hoping that she will be a bright person, a big person,'' she said.
But mostly, they focus on today.
''Mama, I'm itchy,'' Shenay piped.
''This is the big job we do every day: scratch her hair 24 hours,'' Ms. Acheampong said as she pulled her daughter close and gently scratched the back of her head. Shenay's arms are too short to do it.

Unexpectedly broad ethics rule changes that the House passed Thursday are putting new pressure on the Senate.
The House rules leave what lobbyists say are ample loopholes for those seeking to buy access to lawmakers, mainly through campaign fund-raising. But leaders of the new Democratic majority in the Senate said Thursday that they were reintroducing a much less extensive package of changes passed last year as the starting place for an intraparty debate next week over how much further the Senate should go.
Unexpectedly broad ethics rule changes that the House began passing Thursday are putting new pressure on the Senate.
Unexpectedly broad ethics rule changes that the House passed Thursday are putting new pressure on the Senate.
The House rules leave what lobbyists say are ample loopholes for those seeking to buy access to lawmakers, mainly through campaign fund-raising. But leaders of the new Democratic majority in the Senate said Thursday that they were reintroducing a much less extensive package of changes passed last year as the starting place for an intraparty debate next week over how much further the Senate should go.
Saying they were responding to voter backlash against Congressional corruption that helped them take control, House Democrats went beyond some of the ethics proposals on which they had campaigned.
The new House rules bar members from taking gifts, meals or trips paid for by lobbyists, or the organizations that employ them. The rules also ban lawmakers from using corporate jets and reimbursing the owners. A further proposal would also eliminate major loopholes from earlier drafts, in requirements for lawmakers to disclose sponsorship of pet spending projects, or earmarks, and tax breaks they hide in complex legislation.
The House Democrats said that in March they would take up the creation of an independent ethics watchdog to police their own conduct, something lawmakers in both chambers had steadfastly resisted.
In contrast, the initial Senate ethics bill would ban only gifts or meals and not trips paid for by lobbyists or their employers. It would not restrict the use of corporate jets. It would require disclosure of the sponsors of only a small fraction of spending earmarks, excluding those added to supplementary material, called Congressional reports, that explain legislative intent or that are directed through federal agencies like the Defense Department. Nor does the Senate bill propose any independent enforcement.
Some senior Democratic aides said the House rules had upped the ante for the Senate.
''They will be embarrassed'' if they do not do more, said James A. Thurber, a professor of government at American University in Washington and an expert on Congressional ethics rules who has acted as a consultant to several lawmakers. ''When we look at the election, it is a hot issue, so there will be a lot of focus on it in people's minds, and the heat will be on in the Senate.''
Announcing his intention to reintroduce the Senate bill that passed last year, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, promissed to ''improve that legislation and make additional reforms.''
Senior aides in both parties said Mr. Reid was negotiating with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, to try to work out a bipartisan package of changes. Jim Manley, a spokesman for Mr. Reid, said the House actions had no bearing on what the Senate would do.
An overhaul is likely to face strong opposition from veteran senators who resent ethics rules as unnecessary, and helped bring back other changes. But aides to the Senate Rules Committee said they were preparing to match the House ban on meals, gifts and trips paid for by lobbyists or any organization that employs them.
Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who is chairwoman of the Rules Committee, has said she intends to close some of the loopholes in the current bill's earmark disclosure requirements. And despite personal doubts, she has also agreed to hold hearings on creating an independent enforcement watchdog.
Other Democrats, including Senators Barack Obama of Illinois and Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin, planned to push for a far more drastic overhaul.
The Feingold-Obama plan would make lawmakers reimburse corporations for use of their jets at the cost of a charter flight instead of the price of a first-class ticket -- a step that stops short of the House rules. The bill would also create an independent watchdog as the House Democrats have discussed. And it would prohibit lobbyists or the organizations that employ them from holding lavish events for lawmakers at party conventions.
The Feingold-Obama bill would also require lobbyists to disclose any earmarks they are seeking for their clients, and require lobbyists to disclose any collecting and passing on of campaign contributions -- a practice known as ''bundling'' that currently makes K Street the heart of campaign fund-raising for most lawmakers. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, said she and many other newly elected Democrats were working with Mr. Obama, Mr. Feingold and Mr. Reid to pushing for stronger changes, in part because they felt the resonance of the issue on the campaign trail.
''The House bill raises the bar,'' Ms. Klobuchar said, ''but a number of senators have already been talking about their own efforts to strengthen the Senate bill.''
Lobbyists, meanwhile, groused that the rules passed in the House would have the unintended consequence of encouraging them to do more fund-raising for House members. The new rules bar lobbyists from treating lawmakers to meals or trips. But the lobbyists can still raise money for lawmakers' campaigns and also join lawmakers at fund-raising events or on overnight trips paid for with those campaign funds. Lobbyists said people seeking access to lawmakers may now have even more incentive to attend fund-raisers because they can no longer simply buy dinner or lunch.
Lawrence W. Noble, a Washington lawyer specializing in political rules, said lobbyists could well feel obliged to attend more fund-raisers. ''We still have a system of private financing of campaigns,'' Mr. Noble said.

With a decision from the Democratic National Committee on where it will hold its 2008 presidential nominating convention on the horizon, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg appeared to dampen expectations yesterday that the party would choose New York over Denver, the other city still in contention.
Referring to Denver as the city ''which everybody says is the odds-on favorite,'' Mr. Bloomberg emphasized the difficulty of raising enough money to cover the costs of playing host to the convention, sounding very much like a man reluctant to win his own bid.

With a decision from the Democratic National Committee on where it will hold its 2008 presidential nominating convention on the horizon, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg appeared to dampen expectations yesterday that the party would choose New York over Denver, the other city still in contention.
Referring to Denver as the city ''which everybody says is the odds-on favorite,'' Mr. Bloomberg emphasized the difficulty of raising enough money to cover the costs of playing host to the convention, sounding very much like a man reluctant to win his own bid.
''The risks that we might have been willing to run four years ago probably aren't prudent to run today -- we just don't have to do that,'' Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference in Brooklyn, referring to the successful effort to land the 2004 Republican National Convention in the aftermath of the 2001 terror attack, when the city's economic health was in question. ''Every convention, we welcome them here, whether it's for politics or commercial, but we're just not in the business of paying for it.''
After the Republicans chose Minneapolis-St. Paul for their 2008 convention, the Democrats said they would make their selection before the end of last year, but decided to negotiate complete agreements with both competing cities before making that choice. As that process appeared to be coming to a close in December, both efforts hit snags. A crucial labor union in Denver refused to sign a pledge banning strikes during the convention, and Mr. Bloomberg in New York continued to raise alarms about the cost.
Howard Dean, the party chairman, decided to wait until January to announce the convention city.
Now, with Denver's labor situation still unsettled, Democratic officials appear no closer to a final decision, although Mr. Bloomberg's most recent comments seem aimed at lowering expectations that the convention would come East.
''I have no idea what they're going to do,'' Mr. Bloomberg told reporters, referring to Democratic officials. ''As I said, we'd love to have them, but I don't think the city can put itself on the line in this day and age to guarantee'' the $80 million to $100 million needed for such a convention.

BLUNT to the cusp of brusque, Patrick J. Foye, the mergers-and-acquisitions specialist recruited by a long- ago law firm colleague, Eliot Spitzer, to run the downstate portion of the Empire State Development Corporation, is barking into his cellphone in the driveway of his unostentatious home -- a much-remodeled ranch with three nondescript vehicles outside -- in one of Sands Point's less sandy neighborhoods. No streetlights, no sidewalks, no stoplights: except for Mr. Foye and his loud conversation, this wealthy community on Long Island's North Shore is pin-drop territory.

He signs off without ultimatums: ''Just call before you make a final decision. Thanks.'' Click. He gives his beard an absent-minded tug. And no, he won't share the specifics of the chat.
He had not, officially, made the segue from his position as chief executive of the United Way of Long Island (a reclamation project of sorts) to his co-chairmanship of the development corporation, a job he accepted instantly over an egg-whites breakfast with Mr. Spitzer, then the governor-elect, in November, but was already adding his clout to the cause. If you agree to work for a crusader, says Mr. Foye, 49, whose job in the Spitzer administration began this week, you'd better be ready to be one.
''We're going to do projects that generate the highest fiscal and social return to the state and its taxpayers; we're committed to moving forward on the redevelopment of Penn Station and West 34th Street, Atlantic Yards and the revitalization of ground zero, and to other deals throughout the state,'' he says, marching into the dining room after exchanging a monosyllabic greeting with his wife, Suzanne. It appears that Mr. Foye is routinely brief, if affable, with everybody, his three daughters included.
''How are you?'' he asks the oldest, 17. ''I'm sick,'' she says. ''So why are you still going to get a haircut?'' he asks. She shrugs and leaves with her mother, but not before Mr. Foye, wearing a whimsical red tie sprinkled with tiny gray clouds, hollers a quick question at his wife: ''Suzanne, what would you call our decorating style? Cluttered?'' She nods. Her most obvious contribution is Christmas knickknacks and two decorated trees.
His are on the walls, with the overstock crammed in a niche by the fireplace. Mr. Foye collects World War I bond posters insatiably; the pride and joy of his collection is an original rendition of Uncle Sam's ''I Want You,'' circa 1917, purchased for $500, which he estimates is now worth $10,000. ''It's the buy of a lifetime,'' he says, pragmatic even about aesthetics.
HE bought his first poster in 1981 after graduating from Fordham Law School and joining Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Its theme, ''Buy Early,'' struck him as appropriate for a beginner mergers-and-acquisitions lawyer. He became a partner in 1989, and early on worked alongside Eliot and Silda Wall Spitzer, whom he describes as respected colleagues rather than close pals.
''He's a better lawyer than me, and she's better than both of us,'' Mr. Foye remarks. ''This is going to sound toadyish, but what he did as attorney general was a masterpiece of lawyering in the vision he had about how that office could be used. As governor, he's totally focused on making life better for the people of New York.''
To help Mr. Spitzer do that, Mr. Foye, the son of Irish immigrants (his father was an elevator operator, doorman and union leader; his mother, a waitress) and the first in his family to graduate from high school and attend college (on a union scholarship), will have to be adept at squeezing dollars. Mr. Spitzer's budget emphasizes limited spending with no tax increases; his specific advice to Mr. Foye: be a tough deal maker and a nonpartisan decision maker.
''Eliot's mandate is for the agency to become more effective and strategic in developing the economy of the state and to make great strides without spending additional dollars,'' says Mr. Foye, apparently comfortable with the notion of doing more with less. It's similar to the message he preached at United Way, where he spent three years righting the books and reconfiguring the mission.
''It had lost direction, management was tired, and it had lost the confidence of opinion makers,'' he says of the agency. He took a job there in 2004 after leaving a lucrative vice presidency with Aimco, a real estate investment trust, because he chose not to relocate his family to Denver.
His own fiscal conservatism, he says, is evident in the antistatus cars in the driveway. His idea of having a blast is beer, bagpipes and an annual St. Patrick's Day party in the backyard.
''Work is where you trade your time for making money, and money allows you to use your time in ways you choose.'' The Foyes choose travel when he's not working. Mr. Foye, a registered independent who was appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki as deputy chairman of the Long Island Power Authority in 1995, switched from law to business because ''businesspeople are decision makers, capital allocators, and leaders -- and the hours for business folks are better, too.''
And the hours for public servants? Ask his new boss.

A plan to provide high-tech enhancements to New York taxicabs -- including touch-screen monitors that will allow passengers to watch television, get game scores and track their ride on a global positioning system -- drew angry reactions from cabdrivers yesterday who say they will have to foot the bill.
More than a dozen drivers squeezed into a cramped City Council hearing room yesterday to protest the high-tech amenities they will soon be required to install in their vehicles under new city guidelines. The Taxi and Limousine Commission, which regulates city cabdrivers, says the cost of installing and operating the equipment will range from $2,900 to $7,200 per taxi over a three-year period.
The plan drew angry reactions from cabdrivers who said they would have to foot the bill.
A plan to provide high-tech enhancements to New York taxicabs -- including touch-screen monitors that will allow passengers to watch television, get game scores and track their ride on a global positioning system -- drew angry reactions from cabdrivers yesterday who say they will have to foot the bill.
More than a dozen drivers squeezed into a cramped City Council hearing room yesterday to protest the high-tech amenities they will soon be required to install in their vehicles under new city guidelines. The Taxi and Limousine Commission, which regulates city cabdrivers, says the cost of installing and operating the equipment will range from $2,900 to $7,200 per taxi over a three-year period.
The plan also requires drivers to accept credit and debit cards. Drivers say the 3.5 percent transaction fee that they would pay would eat into their profits, and that if the card system is down, they could get stuck with the cab fare if the passenger is without cash.
''We're independent contractors, we're like entrepreneurs, and we're forced to take credit cards,'' said William Lindauer, 63, who said he had driven a cab in the city for 30 years. ''You can't force a restaurant to take credit cards. And entertainment, we're forced to provide entertainment?''
Mr. Lindauer was one of several drivers to testify before the Council's Transportation Committee, which is evaluating the costs and benefits of the new technology.
Commission officials defended the enhancements. The changes stem from a 2004 compromise in which medallion taxicabs -- the yellow cabs regulated by the city -- were allowed to raise fares by 26 percent in exchange for installing several technological improvements to improve customer service.
''These customer service improvements are delivering on a promise that we made to taxi riders almost three years ago, and represent a leap ahead of anything currently being offered to passengers anywhere in the taxi world,'' Matthew W. Daus, chairman of the Taxi and Limousine Commission, said in a statement after yesterday's hearing.
Many of the drivers at the hearing were members of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which represents about 7,000 drivers in the city. At least a few raised the possibility of a strike if the changes are fully instituted.
Drivers say the required global positioning system and automated system that records a trip could lead to an invasion of their privacy. But commission officials say the only data they would collect would be a trip's beginning and end. The commission also said the 3.5 percent credit card fees negotiated with the credit card companies is substantially less than what cab owners pay to accept credit cards.
More than 3,000 cabs accept credit cards around the city, paying about 5 percent per transaction plus a weekly fee of $8 to $12, according to the commission. Commission officials and vendors say allowing customers to pay with credit and debit cards will increase driver profits.
The city began rolling out the first of 200 taxis to be outfitted with the new equipment last month as part of a test. So far, though, only 28 cabs have been fully equipped, according to Andrew Salkin, the first deputy commissioner of the Taxi and Limousine Commission.
The commission expects that all 13,000 medallion cabs in the city will have the equipment installed by the end of 2007.
The commission has signed deals with four vendors to provide the equipment and operate the services. Each will provide different offerings for customers.
The system allows passengers to get information on dining and events around the city, get the latest news and scores, watch movie trailers and choose their own music. They can also get information on their driver and fares and, as is mandated for all the systems, watch as their ride is tracked by a global positioning system along a map. The system also includes advertisements, which the vendors say will eventually cut down on the monthly fees charged to the cab owners.
Ed Sloam, president of TaxiTech, one of the four vendors, said that 76 percent of customers who tested the system in a commission survey loved the system. Those who do not like it can turn it off, he said.
''Taxis in the city are finally coming into the 21st century,'' Mr. Sloam told committee members yesterday.
City Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer of Manhattan, who opposes the enhancements, said passengers should not be subjected to a barrage of advertising.
''I never want to see this, and I promise you no real West Sider wants to see this,'' she said.

Mr. Autrey shoved the student into a trough between the rails and held him there as a No. 1 train rolled over them -- catastrophe mere inches away.
You can't make up stories this good, or come up with a more appealing hero than this 50-year-old workingman. He went to City Hall yesterday, with his two young daughters, to be honored by the mayor. The word ''hero,'' even ''superhero,'' hung in the air, thick as a morning fog. Mr. Autrey was having none of it.
''Superhero, superhero,'' he said, almost mocking the word. ''I don't feel like a superhero.''
''I just did it,'' he said, ''because I saw someone in distress.''
Maybe so. It is safe to say, though, that precious few of us would dream of doing what he did. The odds are far greater that we would end up like the film student, Cameron Hollopeter, 20. Not that we would necessarily tumble onto the tracks. But falling ill in the subway? It happens all the time.
In fact, ''sick customer,'' to use the official lingo, is a major reason for train delays, hundreds of them every month.
From January to October 2006, to cite the most recent statistics available from New York City Transit, queasy riders needing medical attention were responsible for 3,969 delays. The figure for October alone was an unusually high 743. Only track work (14,076 delays) and signal problems (7,567) caused more train backups during that period.
Subway rules demand that conductors stay with ailing riders until help arrives, typically in the form of emergency medical technicians based at Grand Central, Times Square, Queensboro Plaza and other well-trafficked stations. Given that requirement, train delays are inevitable.
What makes riders sick? The reasons are many.
An article this week in AM New York, a free newspaper handed out at subway entrances, blamed poor nutrition, especially among dieting young women. It quoted a subway E.M.T. who spoke of appearance-obsessed women skipping meals, sometimes for days. In the subway, they become light-headed and faint.
That idea was not endorsed by Paul J. Fleuranges, a spokesman for New York City Transit. Then again, it was not dismissed, either. ''Officially, we don't know why people are ill,'' Mr. Fleuranges said.
Frankly, we can see why many New Yorkers, men or women, might want to diet simply to fit into subway seats. Some of the made-in-Japan cars seem designed for made-in-Japan rumps, not New Yorkers' wider beams. You want to talk about trans fats? Try transit fat.
On the No. 1 line, where Mr. Autrey performed his heroics, the contoured seats are 17 inches wide. Your average New Yorker is appreciably wider. As a result, you routinely see seven riders -- and often only six -- filling up space that in theory should seat eight. Should this winter ever turn truly cold, the many Michelin Man jackets will make for an even tighter squeeze.
Even if excessive dieting does not really explain why so many people fall ill, the fact remains that health problems keep trains from running as smoothly as everyone would like. Sick customers account for appreciably more delays than either track fires or -- one of our favorites -- riders' holding train doors and keeping them from closing.
Interestingly, the category of ''suspicious package'' is relatively low among the causes for delays: No. 22 on the list. It accounted for 860 delays in the first 10 months of 2006.
That number ''is nothing to sneeze at,'' Mr. Fleuranges said, but it is well below what it was a year or two earlier, soon after the terrorist bombings on commuter trains in Madrid and London. Rider wariness, Mr. Fleuranges said, ''really does change with the tenor of the times.''
Naturally, transit officials still want people to stay on guard. ''If you see something, say something'' continues to be the slogan.
But Mr. Autrey kicked it up several notches, didn't he? By leaping to the tracks to save a life, he effectively told New Yorkers: ''If you see something, do something.''

Democrats realized their political and legislative dream Thursday. Now they must face reality.
As they take control of the House and Senate, members of the new majority must reconcile diverse ideological factions within their ranks and make a fundamental choice. They can spend their energy trying to reverse what they see as the flaws of the Bush administration and a dozen years in which conservative philosophy dominated Congress. Or they can accept the rightward tilt of that period and grudgingly concede that big tax cuts, deregulation, restrictions on abortion and other Republican-inspired changes are now a permanent part of the legislative framework.
Democrats realized their political and legislative dream Thursday. Now they must face reality.
As they take control of the House and Senate, members of the new majority must reconcile diverse ideological factions within their ranks and make a fundamental choice. They can spend their energy trying to reverse what they see as the flaws of the Bush administration and a dozen years in which conservative philosophy dominated Congress. Or they can accept the rightward tilt of that period and grudgingly concede that big tax cuts, deregulation, restrictions on abortion and other Republican-inspired changes are now a permanent part of the legislative framework.
The competing drives were on display amid the constitutional hoopla Thursday and the emotion surrounding Representative Nancy Pelosi's election as speaker, a position filled until now by the likes of Sam Rayburn, Joseph Cannon and Nicholas Longworth -- men whose names adorn nearby House office buildings. ''We have broken the marble ceiling,'' Mrs. Pelosi said after she was handed the gavel.
In a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus earlier in the day, Mrs. Pelosi made her own allusions to the competing tugs on Democrats, noting the party was rooted in its traditions but not hostage to the past. She promised a new direction ''for all the people, not just the privileged few,'' a reflection of the leadership's political and policy calculation that Democrats need to champion the average guy.
''The agenda we have is about restoring economic security to a very vulnerable middle class,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, chairman of the Democratic Caucus. ''The real activity will be in those areas.''
Yet many Democrats contend that President Bush and the Republican-led Congress that was his partner moved the dial too far to the right in many cases. And they believe it will be the work of Democrats to make a significant course correction.
''I think there are a lot of things the people of America want changed,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, the new chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a tough critic of some Bush policies.
Mr. Leahy and others made clear that the new direction had to begin with American policy in Iraq.
But their domestic legislative agenda suggests that they are picking selected fights rather than going for wholesale change. On the economy, they will move swiftly to increase the minimum wage. On social policy, they will challenge Mr. Bush by calling for expanded stem cell research. They will try to pass legislation increasing college aid for the middle class. All of those issues have the twin advantages of broad popular appeal tied to measurable economic impact on individuals.
But Democrats are in no rush to engage in a fight with Mr. Bush over the ideological centerpiece of his domestic policy, his tax cuts. And they have showed no inclination to wade back into the abortion issue, despite its potency among many of their supporters.
''We have to keep our eye on the average American family and sort of push aside the interest groups left, right and center,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. ''The world has changed, and it demands new solutions, not the old Democrat and Republican nostrums.''
But there is no dispute that Mr. Bush's legislative and executive record will get a microscopic examination via a renewed emphasis on oversight, a Congressional function Democrats say was all but abandoned in recent years. And the results of those inquiries could determine what policies Democrats try to unravel if they uncover a strong case against them.
''The Bush administration has passed an entire architecture of laws that are going to be reviewed,'' said Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, one of the most liberal members of the House.
Republicans are waiting to see what develops, uncertain if Democrats sincerely want to join hands and produce some consensus on public policy. Or, as one senior Republican asked, will Democrats hostile to the Bush administration be more like the scorpion in the fable with the frog, unable to resist the urge to sting even if they hurt themselves?
Democrats acknowledge that with their minuscule majority in the Senate and one in the House that is not much larger, they lack the political muscle to go too far in reversing Bush policy even if that was their chief goal. And they already have their hands full with delivering on their own ambitious legislative agenda, following through on their pledges of bipartisanship and ethics overhaul and avoiding anything that costs the party its chance at the White House in 2008.
Leading Democrats say their best direction is forward, concentrating on establishing a new party legacy rather than obsessing with the perceived failings of Republican rule. The test for the party's newly empowered leadership and the Congressional membership will be whether they can stick to that path.

Capitol Hill observed a National Day of Comity on Thursday. Against the sober backdrop of war and as Democrats ascended in both chambers, people of both parties spoke of how committed they were to working together and changing the political tone.
And how many times have we heard that before?
Capitol Hill observed a National Day of Comity on Thursday. Against the sober backdrop of war and as Democrats ascended in both chambers, people of both parties spoke of how committed they were to working together and changing the political tone.
And how many times have we heard that before?
''Almost on an annual basis,'' said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, a three-decade veteran of civility vows in the capital. ''It's like our New Year's ritual around here.''
But maybe this time really will be different. Like 63-degree weather in January (and cherry blossoms out of season), Washington seemed to have flipped on its head, power-wise, karma-wise, at least for a few hours.
There were children and flowers everywhere, and pictures of Vice President Dick Cheney and Senator Edward M. Kennedy mugging together.
And a warm-looking handshake between the only Muslim in Congress, the newly elected Representative Keith Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, and Representative Virgil H. Goode Jr., a Virginia Republican who had condemned Mr. Ellison's plan to use the Koran at his ceremonial swearing-in. (Mr. Ellison made history in more ways than one at that ceremony Thursday by using a Koran once owned by Thomas Jefferson.)
And dapper old senators saying things like this:
''The place is like a bubbling bottle of Champagne, overflowing with joy and hope and civility,'' said Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia. And to think, this guy is in the minority now.
O.K., so maybe the venerable Mr. Warner was exaggerating a bit. Or indulging in a smidge of sarcasm. But his words and the big smile with which he delivered them neatly captured the spirit of the day.
The Senate's top leaders, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, and Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, convened a bipartisan meeting at 9 a.m. to discuss bipartisanship.
''I'm here for the civility meeting,'' declared one freshman, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, as she stepped out of an aide's Honda outside the Capitol. She pretended to fuss with her hair, as if this were the first day of school and she was nervous. An upper classman, Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, sat in an idling Cadillac a few feet away.
Nearly all senators showed up for the civility meeting, which was held in the plush and ornate Old Senate Chamber. They left the doors open for several extra minutes so the photographers could come in to take pictures of the smiles and shoulder squeezes and hugs all around.
After a few minutes, the meeting reverted to the slightly awkward feel of a junior high school mixer, with the boys and girls (or Ds and Rs) repairing to separate sides of the room. There were a few exceptions, as when Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, took a seat next to Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, after working both sides of the chamber.
At the very least, no one was alleged to have acted in an uncivil manner.
''Of course not,'' reported Senator John E. Sununu, Republican of New Hampshire, shocked -- shocked -- that anyone could even suggest such a thing.
''People want us to stop acting like kindergarten kids,'' said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee.
It was an open question as to how long this era of good feeling would last.
''What time is it?'' Senator Claire McCaskill, a newly elected Democrat from Missouri, asked just before noon. ''It's still early yet.''
Not two minutes later, Senator Jim Bunning was asked a question -- shouted a question, actually -- about this latest of calls for civility.
''We hear them every year,'' Mr. Bunning, a second-term Republican from Kentucky, said before storming off, uncivilly.
But that was the exception Thursday, as was the seemingly unhinged man who had apparently not gotten the comity memo and interrupted a television interview in the Russell Office Building, shouting profanity as he headed out the door with the Capitol police right behind him.
Back on the House side, fresh-faced Representative Patrick Murphy, Democrat of Pennsylvania, was clutching his 6-week-old daughter, Maggie, and talking about how he had choked up when taking the oath a little earlier.
An Army veteran who served in Iraq, Mr. Murphy said his mind had flashed to his time in the service, the oath he took there. And he nearly teared up again as he rubbed the soft cheeks of Maggie, who was sucking on a ''Daddy's Little Girl'' pacifier.
''It seems pretty collegial here,'' said Mr. Murphy, basing his assessment on exactly 90 minutes in the House and on his orientation soon after the election, where a fellow newbie gave up his seat so Mr. Murphy's wife, Jennifer, then very pregnant, could sit down.
''He was a Republican,'' Mr. Murphy recalled. If only he could remember the nice man's name. ''I think he might have been from Florida.''
Put it down as a baby step on the comity journey.

Not the weighty medal from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, the all-expense-paid trip to Disney World, the year's worth of free subway rides, the $10,000 waiting for him from Donald Trump -- not even the popping flashbulbs and the barrage of questions from a throng of reporters at City Hall yesterday could sway Wesley Autrey, now known as the Subway Hero, from his central message: If you see something, do something.
''Good things happen when you do good,'' Mr. Autrey said after the mayor gave him the Bronze Medallion, the city's highest award for exceptional citizenship and outstanding achievement. The award, for jumping onto the tracks at the 137th Street station of the No. 1 line on Tuesday to help Cameron Hollopeter, 20, a film student who had fallen off the platform after having a seizure, puts Mr. Autrey in the company of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Muhammad Ali and Willie Mays.

''I'm not looking at this like I'm the hero,'' said Mr. Autrey, 50, who stood with his daughters, Shuqui, 6, and Syshe, 4. ''The real heroes are the young women and men that are fighting in Iraq now. What I did was something that any and every New Yorker should do, you know what I'm saying? You see somebody in distress, do the right thing. You know? Help out.''
Appearing relaxed throughout the City Hall presentation and allowing himself only a ''Wow, O.K.,'' then giving a few thumbs-ups for the Disney trip and tickets to ''The Lion King,'' Mr. Autrey said that the attention had been overwhelming, adding that he had not expected any of the gifts.
Before heading off to meet Mr. Trump and make a few more appearances for the news media, he hammered home his point, saying that of dozens of people on the platform, only he and two women went to Mr. Hollopeter's aid.
''We got guys and girls overseas dying for us to have our freedoms,'' he said. ''We got to show each other some love.''

Prime Minister Ehud Olmert met President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt on Thursday evening in an effort to give momentum to the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. But the meeting was overshadowed by an Israeli raid in the West Bank in which four Palestinians were killed and 20 wounded.
Mr. Mubarak was clearly embarrassed by the timing of the raid, hours before the meeting of the two leaders in an Egyptian Red Sea resort town, Sharm el Sheik. He called it a hindrance to peace efforts and told Mr. Olmert that Egypt ''rejects and is indignant at the military operation.''
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert met Egypt’s president to seek a way to revive Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, but an Israeli raid dimmed the prospects.
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert met President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt on Thursday evening in an effort to give momentum to the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. But the meeting was overshadowed by an Israeli raid in the West Bank in which four Palestinians were killed and 20 wounded.
Mr. Mubarak was clearly embarrassed by the timing of the raid, hours before the meeting of the two leaders in an Egyptian Red Sea resort town, Sharm el Sheik. He called it a hindrance to peace efforts and told Mr. Olmert that Egypt ''rejects and is indignant at the military operation.''
''Israel's security cannot be achieved through military force but by serious endeavors toward peace,'' Mr. Mubarak added at his news conference with Mr. Olmert.
Mr. Olmert said that he was sorry that innocent Palestinians were hurt, but that Israel would defend itself and was acting to arrest ''terrorists who had killed Israelis.''
He gave no explanation for the timing of the daylight raid, a vain attempt to arrest a wanted militant, which used unusual force in normally quiet Ramallah. He said Israeli troops returned fire, but did not initiate it. ''Things developed in a way that could not have been predicted in advance,'' he said. ''If innocent people were hurt, this was not our intention.''
The Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, with whom Mr. Olmert met last week, condemned the raid, saying in a statement that it ''proved that the Israeli calls for peace and security are fake.'' Palestinians have been calling for an extension of a Gaza truce with Israel to the West Bank.
''The continued aggression will only lead to the destruction of all efforts aimed at realizing peace,'' Mr. Abbas said.
Mr. Olmert and Mr. Mubarak said Egypt was continuing its efforts to secure the release of an Israeli corporal captured in June by militants, offering in exchange several hundred Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. There had been speculation that the two men might be able to announce more concrete progress on the matter, which is blocking more substantive discussions with Mr. Abbas.
Egyptian officials said that they were discussing another Olmert-Abbas meeting with Egyptian and Jordanian leaders present. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is to visit the region this month.
It was an unusual and emotional day for Mr. Olmert, during which he commemorated two legendary Israeli political figures, both of whom he succeeded in their jobs.
Earlier, in Jerusalem, he spoke at the state funeral for the city's fabled former mayor, Teddy Kollek, who died Tuesday at 95 and was buried in the area of the Mount Herzl cemetery reserved for Israel's leaders.
Mr. Olmert defeated Mr. Kollek to become Jerusalem's mayor in a bitter political fight in 1993. He said Israel's first leader, David Ben-Gurion, had declared Jerusalem to be Israel's capital in 1949, but ''Teddy Kollek made it so.''
Thursday also marked a year since Prime Minister Ariel Sharon suffered a second extensive stroke, which left him in a deep coma from which he is not expected to awaken. Mr. Olmert, Mr. Sharon's deputy, was chosen to lead the Kadima Party in his stead and became prime minister, and he acknowledged Mr. Sharon's tragedy at his news conference in Egypt.
In general, Mr. Olmert has been regarded as inferior to Mr. Sharon and Mr. Kollek. In the latest opinion poll, conducted by the Dahaf Institute and reported Thursday in the newspaper Yediot Aharanot, nearly 70 percent of Israelis polled said they disapproved of Mr. Olmert's performance as prime minister. Israelis are unhappy with the way he managed the summer's war against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and do not much like his personality, contrasting him with the more stolid and experienced Mr. Sharon.
Still, Mr. Olmert has proved himself a skilled politician, and early on Thursday Parliament quietly passed his $68 billion budget, a crucial test of his government's ability to survive. The budget battle was always a great drama under Mr. Sharon, but Mr. Olmert, who has expanded his governing coalition to include parties ranging from Labor to the right-wing Israel Beiteinu Party of Avigdor Lieberman, had little difficulty.
Mr. Olmert's office is being rocked, though, by a new corruption scandal. He has not been touched by this scandal, though he has been under investigation for smaller cases of improper use of influence.
But his longtime office director, Shula Zaken, has been put under house arrest and ordered not to contact Mr. Olmert as the police investigate whether she and the director of the Tax Authority, Jackie Matza, tried to help Ms. Zaken's brother and two other businesspeople through the appointment of cronies to key jobs in return for tax breaks.
About 30 people are under some form of detention in the spreading scandal.
The operation in Ramallah by Israeli forces, with armored vehicles, bulldozers and helicopter support, was carried out hours before Mr. Olmert met with Mr. Mubarak.
Palestinians and news reports said the operation was to arrest Rabiah Hamad of Fatah, a senior member of Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades. The army would not confirm that Mr. Hamad was the target, but said the man it wanted was armed and was wounded, but escaped. The army arrested four other wanted Palestinians, a spokesman said.
It was a rare incursion into the heart of Ramallah, and it prompted an angry response. Youths on rooftops threw stones, metal trash barrels, a refrigerator and blocks of concrete at the Israeli Army vehicles. There were mortars fired at the Israeli soldiers, and an exchange of gunfire.
Palestinian medics said four men -- Yussef Abdel Khader, 23; Khalil al-Badawi, 20; Jamal Jawela, 29; and Ala al-Himran, in his 20s -- died at a Ramallah hospital from gunshot wounds.
In Gaza there was continuing violence, with three more men killed in fighting between Fatah and Hamas. The fighting centered around the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza after gunmen surrounded the houses of known political or security figures.
In Beit Lahiya, a senior Fatah commander, Col. Muhammad Gharib, was killed and his wife severely wounded when Hamas militants attacked his home with rifle fire and rocket-propelled grenades. Two of his bodyguards were also killed. About 25 others were wounded in Jabaliya, and local radio was filled with appeals to the gunmen to restore calm.
On Wednesday five Palestinians, including a woman who was a passer-by, were killed and 12 wounded in Fatah-Hamas gun battles, which broke a weeklong lull. Other militant factions arranged a truce overnight and kidnapped members of Hamas and Fatah were released by the other sides, but the truce broke down on Thursday.
The Palestinian prime minister, Ismail Haniya, returned to Gaza on Thursday from hajj, his pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. His entourage underwent a special inspection in El Arish, Egypt, to ensure that he was not carrying large amounts of cash back to Gaza, which has been deprived of most Western aid since Hamas won parliamentary elections last January.
[Early Friday, Mr. Haniya said he and Mr. Abbas had agreed at emergency talks to keep gunmen from their parties off Gaza's streets.]
For the fourth day there was no word about a kidnapped Peruvian photographer for Agence France-Presse, Jaime Rázuri, 50, who is said by colleagues to be lacking a required heart medication.
Palestinian security services have warned foreign journalists to keep out of Gaza for now, because of the kidnappings and chaos.
A leader of the Palestinian People's Party, Bassam al-Salhi, said the security chaos could be resolved only with political agreement. ''The weakness of the Palestinian political system and the situation of the current Hamas-led government have contributed to this state of lawlessness,'' he said.

President Bush intends to name Zalmay Khalilzad, the Afghan-born diplomat who has been ambassador to Iraq for the past 21 months, to be the new envoy to the United Nations, part of a diplomatic shakeup as Mr. Bush prepares to announce a new strategy for the war.
A senior administration official, who had been briefed on the decision but had to discuss it anonymously because the change had not been formally announced, confirmed Thursday that the president had decided to nominate Mr. Khalilzad to the United Nations post.

President Bush intends to name Zalmay Khalilzad, the Afghan-born diplomat who has been ambassador to Iraq for the past 21 months, to be the new envoy to the United Nations, part of a diplomatic shakeup as Mr. Bush prepares to announce a new strategy for the war.
A senior administration official, who had been briefed on the decision but had to discuss it anonymously because the change had not been formally announced, confirmed Thursday that the president had decided to nominate Mr. Khalilzad to the United Nations post.
The official said Mr. Bush intended to name Ryan C. Crocker, the ambassador to Pakistan, to replace Mr. Khalilzad in Baghdad.
If confirmed by the Senate, the appointments would put seasoned, respected diplomats into two of the State Department's most challenging posts. Mr. Khalilzad would replace John R. Bolton, who served temporarily as United Nations ambassador but resigned late last year after concluding he could not win Senate confirmation.
Mr. Bush's decision to transfer Mr. Khalilzad, among the most visible Americans working in Iraq, would effectively accomplish two goals for the administration. As a Sunni Muslim, Mr. Khalilzad has been perceived by some Iraqi Shiites as not sympathetic enough to their views; removing him from Baghdad would help Mr. Bush make a fresh start there. And Mr. Khalilzad had told colleagues that he was ready to leave.
The change also would give the United States the strong voice it needs at the United Nations, particularly after the storm surrounding Mr. Bolton.
The senior administration official said the White House believed that Mr. Khalilzad, as a Muslim who had extensive experience overseas including a stint as ambassador to his native Afghanistan, would bring an important understanding of the Muslim world to his work at the United Nations.
Daniel P. Serwer, the executive director of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, which recently issued a report recommending a new strategy for Iraq, said a Khalilzad nomination would send a message ''that we are taking the U.N. seriously and sending somebody who has real weight with this administration, and who has served in our toughest post.''
But Leon E. Panetta, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton who was one of five Democrats on the study group, said he feared removing Mr. Khalilzad from Baghdad would leave ''a vacuum'' there at a critical time.
''The problem we've had in Iraq is that the people who finally get to understand how that country works suddenly leave,'' Mr. Panetta said. ''He's probably a pretty good appointment for the U.N., but you do have to be nervous about who is going to speak for us in Iraq.''
But some in the administration have suggested that perhaps Mr. Khalilzad has been too prominent a figure in Iraq.
In a classified memorandum written Nov. 8 after visiting Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki in Baghdad, President Bush's national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, said that the president might urge Mr. Khalilzad, who goes by the nickname Zal, to take a lower profile as one way to buttress the Maliki government.
Under the heading ''What we can do to help Maliki,'' Mr. Hadley ticked off a list of suggestions, among them: ''Encourage Zal to move into the background and let Maliki take more credit for positive developments. (We want Maliki to exert his authority -- and demonstrate to Iraqis that he is a strong leader -- by taking action against extremists, not by pushing back on the United States and the Coalition.)''
Unlike the other changes to Mr. Bush's foreign policy team in the last 24 hours, which caught much of Washington off guard, the moves involving Mr. Khalilzad and Mr. Crocker have been the subject of speculation here for weeks, since Mr. Bolton resigned on Dec. 5.
By that time Mr. Khalilzad had already told colleagues that he was ready to for a change of assignment. ABC News first reported the decision about Mr. Khalilzad on its Web site on Thursday afternoon.
Educated in Beirut and the United States (he holds a doctorate from the University of Chicago), the blunt-spoken Mr. Khalilzad, 55, has been a prominent figure in American foreign policy circles since the Reagan administration, when he advised the State Department on the Iran-Iraq war and the Soviet war in Afghanistan.
He later joined the administration of the first President Bush, where he earned a reputation as a hawk who called for the ouster of Saddam Hussein, advice that administration did not take. More recently, senior administration officials say, he was considered for the No. 2 State Department job that John D. Negroponte is expected to take.
Mr. Crocker, 57, has been a Foreign Service officer since 1971 and is among the State Department's most respected voices in the Middle East. He has been ambassador to Pakistan since 2004, and has served as ambassador to Syria, Kuwait and Lebanon.

President Hugo Chávez abruptly fired his vice president and his interior minister on Wednesday night, issuing a rare public acknowledgment that violent crime and prison killings were severe problems.
Mr. Chávez, who announced the dismissals in a telephone call to a talk show on state television, cited grisly prison melees and an inability to prevent a rapid increase in killings as reasons for the removal of Jesse Chacón as the minister of the interior and justice. Mr. Chávez did not give a reason for firing José Vicente Rangel, long one of his closest confidants, as vice president.

Mr. Chávez did not give a reason for firing José Vicente Rangel, long one of his closest confidants, as vice president.
''There are failings in internal security and infrastructure,'' Mr. Chávez said, referring in particular to the clashes this week between rival gangs at Uribana Prison in western Lara State that left 16 inmates dead. An additional six inmates from Uribana were killed after being transferred to another prison in Portuguesa State. Twenty-five inmates have been killed this week in prisons across Venezuela.
Mr. Chávez also cited ''violence in the streets'' in dismissing Mr. Chacón, who was presiding over an effort to reform Venezuela's police forces. Violent crime ranks in polls as the top concern of Venezuelans amid an increase in kidnappings and killings. Homicides are up 67 percent since 1999, when the Chávez presidency began, and the country has one of the highest rates of gun-related deaths in the world, according to Unesco.
Venezuela's prison system suffers from crowding, corruption and a shortage of trained guards. Violent prison deaths have averaged more than 300 a year for more than a decade. Building prisons has not alleviated the problem.
Security analysts say that part of the difficulty in reducing violent crime levels is related to the frequency with which senior officials overseeing efforts at improving the justice system are moved out of their posts. Mr. Chacón was replaced by Pedro Carreño, a legislator who led an inquiry last year into a $1.5 million embezzlement scheme at a state sugar complex built with help from Cuban technicians in Sabaneta, Mr. Chávez's hometown, in Barinas State. He will be Mr. Chávez's ninth interior minister in eight years.
On Thursday, Finance Minister Nelson Merentes said he was stepping down, to be replaced by Rodrigo Cabezas, a leftist legislator and economist.
Mr. Chávez named Jorge Rodríguez, a former medical director at a psychiatric clinic here, as vice president. Mr. Rodríguez, whose father was tortured by the Venezuelan Army in the 1970s, has impeccable credentials in leftist circles. He led the National Electoral Council during a contentious and ultimately unsuccessful effort to recall Mr. Chávez.

The No. 2 job in the State Department is technically a step down from John Negroponte's present post of director of national intelligence. But the reported return to the foreign policy fold of this former ambassador to Baghdad, and, before that, to the United Nations, has a certain logic to it.

The diplomacy-challenged Bush administration could surely use the help. We hope that Mr. Negroponte can provide Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice with the intellectual and bureaucratic reinforcement she so desperately needs to help guide the administration to a wiser course on Iraq.
Mr. Negroponte certainly has experience. In a 40-plus-year career -- including an early stint as a political officer in Vietnam -- he has also served as ambassador to Honduras (during Ronald Reagan's contra war), Mexico and the Philippines. He is known as a canny, and sometimes ruthless, bureaucratic player. What he doesn't have, unfortunately, is much of a reputation for challenging the unwise policy presumptions of his bosses.
In his 10 months in Baghdad from mid-2004 to mid-2005, Mr. Negroponte undoubtedly saw the yawning gap between Iraq's grim reality and the delusional claims of success issuing from Washington. While President Bush and other top officials trumpeted effective military training programs, a flowering Iraqi democracy and an insurgency ever on its last legs, anyone on the ground had to see paper Iraqi battalions, the rise of sectarian militias and ever-expanding chaos.
If Mr. Negroponte made a serious effort to jolt his bosses back to the real world, there is no public record of it. That will have to change if he is to have any chance of improving things. Before confirming him, the Senate should make sure he understands that asking hard and unwelcome questions is an essential part of the job.
Mr. Negroponte's switch will mean another wrenching shift in the top ranks of America's deeply troubled intelligence agencies. One of the main problems that the national intelligence director's job was created to solve was the destructive rivalries between intelligence agencies run by the Defense Department and their civilian counterparts.
That infighting reached a crescendo during the reign of Donald Rumsfeld at the Pentagon. Mr. Rumsfeld's replacement, Robert Gates, a former director of central intelligence, will have the credibility -- and we hope the will -- to calm those rivalries and improve interagency coordination. Even then, Mr. Bush must quickly find a credible replacement for Mr. Negroponte, preferably one who is willing to jolt his bosses with the truth. This administration's record of failures in Iraq is matched only by its failures on intelligence.

As the minimum wage moves to the top of the new Congress's agenda, some politicians -- mainly President Bush and Senate Republicans -- seem incapable of viewing the issue as anything other than a pretext for more tax cuts. This time the lucky recipients would be small-business owners, who the politicians contend will be unduly harmed by having to pay higher wages. So much for ringing in the new.
It has been more than nine years since the government last increased the federal minimum wage, currently $5.15 an hour. During that period inflation has severely eroded the wage's value. Arguing that it is only fair to cut taxes on business owners when the minimum wage goes up is akin to arguing that taxes should have been raised as the wage fell because of inflation. Instead, as the minimum wage has eroded over the past decade, taxes have been cut sharply.

Arguing that it is only fair to cut taxes on business owners when the minimum wage goes up is akin to arguing that taxes should have been raised as the wage fell because of inflation. Instead, as the minimum wage has eroded over the past decade, taxes have been cut sharply.
It's even doubtful that the wage increase under discussion -- a $2.10 increase over roughly two years, to $7.25 -- would impair business. Eighty-six percent of small-business owners surveyed by the Wells Fargo/Gallup Small Business Index said the minimum wage had no effect on their businesses.
There's also no reason to believe that the proposed tax cuts would be aimed at employers of low-wage workers. In 2006, when Congress tried to link the minimum wage to tax cuts, the proposals included an estate-tax cut for America's wealthiest families. One proposal now being considered would allow small businesses to write off a larger part of their attorney fees when they go to court to challenge federal regulations. It sounds like a stretch to us that typical employers of minimum-wage workers -- say, restaurants and small factories -- are in any great need of relief from the high cost of federal litigation.
And then there's the probability that tax cuts would cost the government far more than a wage increase would ever cost employers, driving up the budget deficit. The Economic Policy Institute analyzed the tax cuts that were linked to an unsuccessful attempt to raise the minimum wage in 2000. Those cuts would have cost $123 billion over 10 years, versus $11.2 billion for the wage increase.
It's that sort of idiocy the new Congress was elected to stop. Chances are good the House of Representatives will eschew tax cuts and pass a clean bill to raise the minimum wage. The Senate should follow suit. And President Bush should sign it.

New Jersey could take the lead among states in abolishing the death penalty if it follows the recommendation that a legislative commission made this week. It is the right thing to do, and not just because capital punishment is barbaric and a poor deterrent. It has become increasingly clear as the use of DNA evidence has grown that there is simply too great a risk of making an irreversible mistake.
While we would have used stronger language, we applaud the 13-member panel for having the courage to recommend that New Jersey become the first state to abolish the death penalty since states began reinstating it 35 years ago. The commission included two prosecutors, a police chief, members of the clergy and a man whose daughter was murdered in 2000. Only one member, a former state senator who wrote the death penalty law, dissented.

Although it has nine people on death row, New Jersey has had a moratorium on executions since 2005 and has not put anyone to death since 1963. Nevertheless, the panel's recommendation that the death penalty be replaced with life imprisonment without parole is likely to have significant influence both inside and outside the state. It comes as about 10 of the 38 states with death penalties, including New York, have suspended executions and as recent developments, like DNA exonerations and a botched lethal injection in Florida last month, have created a growing unease about executions.
With Gov. Jon Corzine opposed to the death penalty, and substantial numbers of capital punishment opponents in both houses of the Legislature, there is a reasonable chance the commission's recommendations will become law. That would make New Jersey's criminal justice system more civilized and fair. It could also prod other states to abandon their own use of what Justice Harry Blackmun called the ''machinery of death.''

To the Editor:
David Brooks (''A Snit in First Class,'' column, Jan. 4) asks why rich politicians like Nancy Pelosi and George W. Bush can't just get along.
The answer is simple: Some wealthy politicians use their positions to further the interests of the wealthy.
They pursue policies that shift income upward and the tax burden down; that strip away protections for workers; that favor insurance companies, drug makers and other corporate interests over the interests of ordinary people.
But other wealthy politicians think that public servants are supposed to serve the public.
The wealthy-for-the-wealthy politicians resent their more publicly minded peers and invent clever denigrations like ''traitor to his class'' or ''limousine liberal.''
Because, as Mr. Brooks notes, political success depends on the ability to raise large sums of money, the wealthy will be overrepresented in public office. We are lucky that at least a few of them -- the Kennedys, Pelosis, Kerrys and others -- sometimes fight against their more self-serving wealthy counterparts rather than just going along.
Jay Livingston  New York, Jan. 4, 2007
To the Editor:
David Brooks dreams of reconciliation between our ranch-owning millionaire Republicans like George W. Bush and our vineyard-owning millionaire Democrats like Nancy Pelosi. His alternative dream is that a group of ''highly attractive dimwits'' spread ''bland but worthy stability over our political scene.''
How about this one mundane dream: universal health care for all American citizens regardless of wits, party or money?
Suzy Sandor  New York, Jan. 4, 2007
To the Editor:
It's true that Speaker Nancy Pelosi's wealth facilitated her election to the House. Unlike her fellow ''plutocrats'' on the other side of the aisle, however, her policy agenda is topped by bills to increase the minimum wage and to insure the nearly 50 million Americans without medical coverage, not expand the privileges of the ''haves'' and the ''have mores.''
Rather than discovering the class solidarity that David Brooks sarcastically commends, the rest of us should be glad that Democrats in many of their legislative goals remain traitors to their class.
Marc Joseph  Oakland, Calif., Jan. 4, 2007
To the Editor:
David Brooks chides Nancy Pelosi for owning a vineyard, being chauffeured to school as a child, investing in high-end real estate, and wearing pearls.
Yet Republicans have always maintained that wealth is a natural right in our country -- and how do her offenses compare with those of a political leader who sends 3,000 troops to die in a false war?

Re ''A Man Down, a Train Arriving, and a Stranger Makes a Choice'' (front page, Jan. 3):
The story of Wesley Autrey, a construction worker and Navy veteran, risking his own life to come to the assistance of a fellow rider is inspiring, to say the least. But it also reminds us of the diminishing encouragement of certain values in many of our next generation.
Perhaps because he was raised that way or because of his Navy roots, the choice Mr. Autrey made was the product of the values of courage, honor and selfless service, values that he will probably pass to his children, who witnessed his incredible act of bravery.
All citizens should ask themselves whether they could do what Mr. Autrey did. They should ask whether their kids will.

Back in the early days of World War I, my father, horseplaying with pals on the subway platform, was pushed to the tracks just as a train was arriving. An anonymous sailor jumped from the platform and protected him, just as Wesley Autrey did.
Over the years, I have related the story, only to find that there are a lot of skeptics out there. My father realized that he had been childishly ungrateful but forever believed that he owed his life to the bravery of the anonymous sailor.
Congratulations to Mr. Autrey for his swiftness of thought and action and for his own uncommon bravery.

If the United States' pre-emptive invasion of Iraq is considered one of the major strategic blunders in American history, the execution of Saddam Hussein while the United States was the occupying force in Iraq may come close to rivaling that blunder.
Why couldn't Iraqi justice be served once there was a functioning Iraqi government and United States forces were out of Iraq, and why couldn't the Bush administration have insisted that this be so?

Lies were told to go to this war, and lies were told to extend it. Now there are brand-new lies that promise victory only if we add more troops.

Christopher Woods  Houston, Jan. 4, 2007
To the Editor:
Your editorial doesn't mention the fact that President Bush has not yet watched the cellphone video of Saddam Hussein's execution, according to White House spokesmen.
Let me get this straight: the delivery of Saddam Hussein to justice was one of the president's only legitimate reasons left standing for the invasion of Iraq; the United States held him in custody until the Iraqi government requested that he be delivered to pay the ultimate price; the United States may have delivered him ''into the hands of a Shiite lynch mob''; there is a worldwide outcry about the circumstances surrounding the execution; and the Bush administration is struggling to distance itself from the execution.
And yet the president has not even bothered to watch the video to assess the situation? With our worldwide credibility once again on the line, how can we ever trust that he knows what he is talking about?

Re ''Iraq to Examine Abusive Conduct Toward Hussein'' (front page, Jan. 3):
The ''trial'' of Saddam Hussein, measured by most American judicial standards, might be considered a farce. It is ironic that there is now some upset that during the execution of Mr. Hussein, after his release from American custody, there seemed to be a lack of dignity and courtesy among the participants. Could it be that it is the execution itself that lacks dignity and courtesy?
John Maguire  Oakland, Calif., Jan. 3, 2007
To the Editor:
Such a fuss in your paper over the ''abusive conduct'' toward Saddam Hussein! Perhaps the Shiites should have consulted Miss Manners on the proper decorum for the execution of a mass murderer?
Donald Hoffmann  Kansas City, Mo., Jan. 3, 2007
To the Editor:
Tony Snow, the White House press secretary, when asked about the appalling cellphone video of Saddam Hussein's execution, declared that ''the most important thing to keep in mind is, this is a guy who killed hundreds of thousands of people and received justice,'' while absolving the Americans of responsibility for handing him over to the Shiite Iraqi regime just minutes before he was hanged (''Despite Misgivings, White House Says Little Against Hanging,'' news article, Jan. 4).
Supervising hasty executions, of course, was one of George W. Bush's precious few qualifications for office six years ago. Still, the White House cannot have it both ways, extolling the virtues of democracy while overlooking the expanding disaster in Iraq.
The world's democracies, many of which have banned the death penalty, can only conclude that America cares little for the rule of law.
Timothy Stewart-Winter  Chicago, Jan. 4, 2007

Why is it so hard for our elected officials to admit error? The lynching of Saddam Hussein was wrong, whether or not you agree with capital punishment and irrespective of the magnitude of his crimes.

Universal health care, much as we need it, won't happen until there's a change of management in the White House. In the meantime, however, Congress can take an important step toward making our health care system less wasteful, by fixing the Medicare Middleman Multiplication Act of 2003.
Officially, of course, it was the Medicare Modernization Act. But as we learned during the debate over Social Security, in Bushspeak ''modernize'' is a synonym for ''privatize.'' And one of the main features of the legislation was an effort to bring private-sector fragmentation and inefficiency to one of America's most important public programs.

Universal health care, much as we need it, won't happen until there's a change of management in the White House. In the meantime, however, Congress can take an important step toward making our health care system less wasteful, by fixing the Medicare Middleman Multiplication Act of 2003.
Officially, of course, it was the Medicare Modernization Act. But as we learned during the debate over Social Security, in Bushspeak ''modernize'' is a synonym for ''privatize.'' And one of the main features of the legislation was an effort to bring private-sector fragmentation and inefficiency to one of America's most important public programs.
The process actually started in the 1990s, when Medicare began allowing recipients to replace traditional Medicare -- in which the government pays doctors and hospitals -- with private managed-care plans, in which the government pays a fee to an H.M.O. The magic of the marketplace was supposed to cut Medicare's costs.
The plan backfired. H.M.O.'s received fees reflecting the medical costs of the average Medicare recipient, but to maximize profits they selectively enrolled only healthier seniors, leaving sicker, more expensive people in traditional Medicare. Once Medicare became aware of this cream-skimming and started adjusting payments to reflect beneficiaries' health, the H.M.O.'s began dropping out: their extra layer of bureaucracy meant that they had higher costs than traditional Medicare and couldn't compete on a financially fair basis.
That should have been the end of the story. But for the Bush administration and its Congressional allies, privatization isn't a way to deliver better government services -- it's an end in itself. So the 2003 legislation increased payments to Medicare-supported H.M.O.'s, which were renamed Medicare Advantage plans. These plans are now heavily subsidized.
According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent federal body that advises Congress on Medicare issues, Medicare Advantage now costs 11 percent more per beneficiary than traditional Medicare. According to the Commonwealth Fund, which has a similar estimate of the excess cost, the subsidy to private H.M.O.'s cost Medicare $5.4 billion in 2005.
The inability of private middlemen to win a fair competition against traditional Medicare was embarrassing to those who sing the praises of privatization. Maybe that's why the Bush administration made sure that there is no competition at all in Part D, the drug program. There's no traditional Medicare version of Part D, in which the government pays drug costs directly. Instead, the elderly must get coverage from a private insurance company, which then receives a government subsidy.
As a result, Part D is highly confusing. It's also needlessly expensive, for two reasons: the insurance companies add an extra layer of bureaucracy, and they have limited ability to bargain with drug companies for lower prices (and Medicare is prohibited from bargaining on their behalf). One indicator of how much Medicare is overspending is the sharp rise in prices paid by millions of low-income seniors whose drug coverage has been switched from Medicaid, which doesn't rely on middlemen and does bargain over prices, to the new Medicare program.
The costs imposed on Medicare by gratuitous privatization are almost certainly higher than the cost of providing health insurance to the eight million children in the United States who lack coverage. But recent news analyses have suggested that Democrats may not be able to guarantee coverage to all children because this would conflict with their pledge to be fiscally responsible. Isn't it strange how fiscal responsibility is a big concern when Congress is trying to help children, but a nonissue when Congress is subsidizing drug and insurance companies?
What should Congress do? The new Democratic majority is poised to reduce drug prices by allowing -- and, probably, requiring -- Medicare to negotiate prices on behalf of the private drug plans. But it should go further, and force Medicare to offer direct drug coverage that competes on a financially fair basis with the private plans. And it should end the subsidy to Medicare Advantage, forcing H.M.O.'s to engage in fair competition with traditional Medicare.
Conservatives will fight fiercely against these moves. They say they believe in competition -- but they're against competition that might show the public sector doing a better job than the private sector. Progressives should support these moves for the same reason. Ending the subsidies to middlemen, in addition to saving a lot of money, would point the way to broader health care reform.

ONE of the pop heroes of the Iraq war was undoubtedly Muhammad Said al-Sahhaf, the unfortunate Iraqi information minister who, in his daily press conferences during the invasion, heroically denied even the most evident facts and stuck to the Iraqi line. Even with American tanks only a few hundred yards from his office, he continued to claim that the televised shots of tanks on the Baghdad streets were just Hollywood special effects.
In his very performance as an excessive caricature, Mr. Sahhaf thereby revealed the hidden truth of the ''normal'' reporting: there were no refined spins in his comments, just a plain denial. There was something refreshingly liberating about his interventions, which displayed a striving to be liberated from the hold of facts and thus of the need to spin away their unpleasant aspects: his stance was, ''Whom do you believe, your eyes or my words?''
The United States is continuing, through other means, the greatest crime of Saddam Hussein: his never-ending attempt to topple the Iranian government.

There was something refreshingly liberating about his interventions, which displayed a striving to be liberated from the hold of facts and thus of the need to spin away their unpleasant aspects: his stance was, ''Whom do you believe, your eyes or my words?''
Furthermore, sometimes, he even struck a strange truth -- when confronted with claims that Americans were in control of parts of Baghdad, he snapped back: ''They are not in control of anything -- they don't even control themselves!''
What, exactly, do they not control? Back in 1979, in her essay ''Dictatorship and Double Standards,'' published in Commentary, Jeane J. Kirkpatrick elaborated the distinction between ''authoritarian'' and ''totalitarian'' regimes. This concept served as the justification of the American policy of collaborating with right-wing dictators while treating Communist regimes much more harshly: authoritarian dictators are pragmatic rulers who care about their power and wealth and are indifferent toward ideological issues, even if they pay lip service to some big cause; in contrast, totalitarian leaders are selfless fanatics who believe in their ideology and are ready to put everything at stake for their ideals.
Her point was that, while one can deal with authoritarian rulers who react rationally and predictably to material and military threats, totalitarian leaders are much more dangerous and have to be directly confronted.
The irony is that this distinction encapsulates perfectly what went wrong with the United States occupation of Iraq: Saddam Hussein was a corrupt authoritarian dictator striving to keep his hold on power and guided by brutal pragmatic considerations (which led him to collaborate with the United States in the 1980s). The ultimate proof of his regime's secular nature is the fact that in the Iraqi elections of October 2002 -- in which Saddam Hussein got a 100 percent endorsement, and thus overdid the best Stalinist results of 99.95 percent -- the campaign song played again and again on all the state media was Whitney Houston's ''I Will Always Love You.''
One outcome of the American invasion is that it has generated a much more uncompromising ''fundamentalist'' politico-ideological constellation in Iraq. This has led to a predominance of the pro-Iranian political forces there -- the intervention basically delivered Iraq to Iranian influence. One can imagine how, if President Bush were to be court-martialed by a Stalinist judge, he would be instantly condemned as an ''Iranian agent.'' The violent outbursts of the recent Bush politics are thus not exercises in power, but rather exercises in panic.
Recall the old story about the factory worker suspected of stealing: every evening, when he was leaving work, the wheelbarrow he rolled in front of him was carefully inspected, but the guards could not find anything, it was always empty. Finally, they got the point: what the worker was stealing were the wheelbarrows themselves.
This is the trick being attempted by those who claim today, ''But the world is nonetheless better off without Saddam!'' They forget to factor into the account the effects of the very military intervention against him. Yes, the world is better without Saddam Hussein -- but is it better if we include into the overall picture the ideological and political effects of this very occupation?
The United States as a global policeman -- why not? The post-cold-war situation effectively called for some global power to fill the void. The problem resides elsewhere: recall the common perception of the United States as a new Roman Empire. The problem with today's America is not that it is a new global empire, but that it is not one. That is, while pretending to be an empire, it continues to act like a nation-state, ruthlessly pursuing its interests. It is as if the guiding vision of recent American politics is a weird reversal of the well-known motto of the ecologists -- act globally, think locally.
After 9/11, the United States was given the opportunity to realize what kind of world it was part of. It might have used the opportunity -- but it did not, instead opting to reassert its traditional ideological commitments: out with the responsibility and guilt with respect to the impoverished third world -- we are the victims now!
Apropos of the Hague tribunal, the British writer Timothy Garton Ash pathetically claimed: ''No Führer or Duce, no Pinochet, Amin or Pol Pot, should ever again feel themselves protected from the reach of international law by the palace gates of sovereignty.'' One should simply take note of what is missing in this series of names which, apart from the standard couple of Hitler and Mussolini, contains three third world dictators: where is at least one name from the major powers who might sleep a bit uneasily?
Or, closer to the standard list of the bad guys, why was there little talk of delivering Saddam Hussein or, say, Manuel Noriega to The Hague? Why was the only trial against Mr. Noriega for drug trafficking, rather than for his murderous abuses as a dictator? Was it because he would have disclosed his past ties with the C.I.A.?
In a similar way, Saddam Hussein's regime was an abominable authoritarian state, guilty of many crimes, mostly toward its own people. However, one should note the strange but key fact that, when the United States representatives and the Iraqi prosecutors were enumerating his evil deeds, they systematically omitted what was undoubtedly his greatest crime in terms of human suffering and of violating international justice: his invasion of Iran. Why? Because the United States and the majority of foreign states were actively helping Iraq in this aggression.
And now the United States is continuing, through other means, this greatest crime of Saddam Hussein: his never-ending attempt to topple the Iranian government. This is the price you have to pay when the struggle against the enemies is the struggle against the evil ghosts in your own closet: you don't even control yourself.

The foot was balanced on a shopping bag after being scooped up off the dirty street by a man in a track suit. There was no person to go with the limb. Nearby a charred body was still smoldering, smoke coming off the black corpse 45 minutes after the attack.
For 50 yards, the dead were scattered about, some in pieces, some whole but badly burned.
This violence on Thursday involved two bombs timed to go off one after another in the formerly upscale neighborhood of Mansour, which continues to be ripped apart by sectarian violence. Thirteen people were killed and 22 wounded, just a small fraction of the civilians killed across the country this week.
The first device went off at 10:15 a.m., probably a roadside bomb set on a timer, officials said.
The attack was apparently aimed at a gasoline station. Cars were lined up around the block waiting for fuel, and dozens of people, grasping large plastic jugs, hoped to buy heating fuel.
Just moments after the first explosion, a second, larger, car bomb detonated.
The neighborhood has traditionally been a mixed Sunni and Shiite one. Although the Abu Jaffar gas station, where the attack was centered, is in what is considered a Sunni area, the method of the attack -- multiple bombs timed to explode in succession -- is usually thought of as a trademark of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a Sunni insurgent group.
An hour after the explosion, there was still a strong stench of burning gasoline and fire. The road was slick with sludge from the water used to douse the fire. Blood pooled in areas. Scores of armed men were running about, including members of the Iraqi Army and the police. Some of those with machine guns had no uniforms at all.
Shots rang out, mostly in warning. Neighbors gathered outside, oddly calm and seemingly accustomed to such carnage.
A tanker truck filled with fuel was parked near the station, having escaped the blast.
Not surprisingly, residents living near the area blamed everyone from the government to the Americans to terrorists for what had happened.
''We are just innocent people,'' said Nafia Abdul Jabbar. ''The people killed were poor, in need of kerosene that they cannot afford to buy on the black market because the price is 10 times more than it is at the station.''
Elsewhere, a mortar attack was directed at the Shiite neighborhood of Huriya, wounding three people, officials said.
Clashes on the outskirts of the Sunni neighborhood of Ghazaliya left two people dead and 25 people wounded, Iraqi officials said. A grenade attack in the Amin neighborhood killed five people.
Across the city on Thursday, officials said, 47 bodies were found mutilated -- 4 of them with their heads cut off.
An interview with the family of a man recently mutilated and killed, a prominent sheik considered to be the prince of the Tamim tribes, gives a glimpse into the complicated underworld that is, in part, responsible for the trucks full of bodies collected around this city every day.
The man, Sheik Hamid Mohammed al-Suhail, 75, was found Wednesday in the Shuala neighborhood of Baghdad, a Shiite redoubt, by members of his tribe, which is mixed Shiite and Sunni, who were searching for him. He disappeared last Sunday, and his mutilated body was found wrapped in a blanket, covered in blood. The search party recognized his body by the distinctive way the beard was trimmed.
He had been an outspoken critic of the sectarian fighting and participated in a recent conference in Cairo on national reconciliation.
The kidnappers, whom his relatives hinted they knew but would describe only as ''militiamen'' for fear of reprisal, initially called his family asking for $100,000, said a nephew, Sheik Ali Sammi al-Suhail.
The family told the kidnappers they did not have the money, the nephew said.
''The body was mutilated in a brutal way,'' he said. ''They used a drill on him and perhaps other tools.''
One hand and one leg were almost completely severed.
The nephew said he had been told by people who said they witnessed the killing that after his uncle was tortured, his body was thrown from a two-story building. He survived the fall but was brutalized further before finally being killed.
Another prominent Iraqi figure, Sheik Akram al-Zubeidi, was killed Thursday in Karbala, a Shiite holy city where there has been little sectarian strife. Sheik Zubeidi was assassinated when he was stopped at a fake checkpoint, a local hospital official said.
Three other people in the car with him were also killed by the gunmen, whose motive was unclear.
There was continued fallout Thursday from the execution of Saddam Hussein, as Sunnis, from Kashmir to Libya, used his death as a rallying point.
The Libyan government announced that it would erect a statue of him to stand next to one of Libya's own national heroes, news agencies reported.
At least nine people were hurt in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir when the police fired rubber-coated bullets to break up a large group of people protesting the execution, Reuters reported.
Two Iraqi officials involved in the investigation of the distribution of a graphic video of the hanging said Thursday that a second guard was being held for questioning. Officials announced the arrest of the first guard on Wednesday.
There is increasing pressure, including from the White House, on the Iraqi government to proceed with caution in carrying out the execution of Mr. Hussein's two co-defendants, Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, Mr. Hussein's half brother, and Awad al-Bandar, a former judge.
Despite the international reaction directed at the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, Mr. Maliki's popularity among Shiites in southern Iraq seems to have increased.
In Basra, Iraq's second largest city, hundreds of demonstrators representing Islamist parties rallied in the streets, praising Mr. Maliki and setting photos of Mr. Hussein on fire.

The execution of Saddam Hussein was initially hailed as an example of democratic justice being served in Iraq, but leading members of Congress said Thursday that the conduct surrounding the hanging could undermine United States strategy in Iraq and complicate efforts to help the new Iraqi government succeed.
The White House has declined to criticize the execution, portions of which were shown online in a bootlegged video. Several Republican senators who have been among President Bush's biggest supporters in the Iraq war said they were troubled by the video and fearful of the reverberations it could provoke.
The execution of Saddam Hussein was initially hailed as an example of democratic justice being served in Iraq, but leading members of Congress said Thursday that the conduct surrounding the hanging could undermine United States strategy in Iraq and complicate efforts to help the new Iraqi government succeed.
The White House has declined to criticize the execution, portions of which were shown online in a bootlegged video. Several Republican senators who have been among President Bush's biggest supporters in the Iraq war said they were troubled by the video and fearful of the reverberations it could provoke.
''It's a very bad thing, it's harmful, and I'm sorry that it happened,'' said Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican who has been a White House ally on its Iraq policy. ''Obviously, it unnecessarily inflames the emotions of the Sunnis.''
While the White House says that Mr. Bush has not seen the video -- recorded without authorization with a cellphone camera -- several members of Congress said that they had seen it. More important, they said, the rest of the world had, too.
As Mr. Bush inches closer to presenting his revised Iraq plan, Republican and Democratic lawmakers expressed dismay at the scene surrounding the final minutes of Mr. Hussein's life. They said it was another sign of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki's inability to deal with the sectarian divide in Iraq.
''It is a very unfortunate episode, and they are still trying to sort out accountability,'' said Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia. ''The key to success in Iraq -- whatever success we are able to achieve -- is reconciliation, and this certainly was not a helpful chapter in that.''
Whether the execution ultimately has political repercussions beyond Iraq and here in the United States remains an open question. But as senators prepared to be called to the White House as early as Friday for briefings about the president's Iraq plan, the video emerged as a new complication.
In the video, Mr. Hussein was shown standing with the noose around his neck at dawn last Saturday in Baghdad, facing a barrage of mockery and derision from unseen tormentors. The images showed Mr. Hussein amid shouts of ''Go to hell!'' and ''Moktada! Moktada! Moktada!'' in reference to a radical Shiite cleric, Moktada al-Sadr.
Speaking at the White House after a meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Thursday, Mr. Bush said he had wished the execution had ''been done in a more dignified way.'' He said he appreciated that Mr. Maliki was investigating the way the execution was handled, but that he did not dwell on it during their video conference on Thursday. Mr. Bush said Mr. Hussein had received a fair trial, the likes of which his enemies had not. ''He was given justice; the thousands of people he killed were not,'' Mr. Bush said.
Senator Susan M. Collins, a Maine Republican, said she was troubled by the swiftness of the execution, adding that ''taunting someone who is about to be executed is just blatantly unacceptable.'' The images contained in the video would almost certainly inflame sectarian tensions throughout the region, she said.
''I have no grief for Saddam Hussein, but it makes it more difficult for Iraqi leaders to forge the political solution that I think is necessary to quell the violence,'' Ms. Collins said. ''It threatens the very existence of the nation and thousands of Americans and Iraqi lives to have Saddam mocked before his execution.''
It was unclear whether the newly ascendant Democrats in Congress planned to make an issue of the handling of the execution. It is not likely to be a part of promised Senate hearings on President Bush's Iraq policy, according to aides in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
At the State Department, the official response has been that the execution, while imperfect, is in the past and that people should move on. But aides to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice continued to bemoan what one official called ''the idea that of all the people in that room, Saddam Hussein was the one who looked like he had the most dignity.''
Senator Richard G. Lugar, an Indiana Republican, said the circumstances surrounding the execution were ''another factor that makes life more difficult for the Iraqi government as well as for our hopes for that government and stability.'' But the video, he said, ''is by no means the most difficult issue we are facing in Iraq.''

296 <html><head><b><center>White House Denies Switch In Mail Policy<center></b></head><p align="left">White House says Pres Bush is not claiming any new executive authority in issuing statement suggesting postal inspectors can open mail without warrant in emergency circumstances (M)
The White House said Thursday that President Bush was not claiming any new executive authority last month when he issued a statement suggesting that postal inspectors could open mail without a warrant in emergency circumstances.
Tony Snow, the White House spokesman, said the statement Mr. Bush issued in signing postal legislation was merely a restatement of existing law allowing mail to be opened without a warrant in ''exigent circumstances'' to protect public safety.
President Bush had issued a statement suggesting that postal inspectors could open mail without a warrant in emergency circumstances.
The White House said Thursday that President Bush was not claiming any new executive authority last month when he issued a statement suggesting that postal inspectors could open mail without a warrant in emergency circumstances.
Tony Snow, the White House spokesman, said the statement Mr. Bush issued in signing postal legislation was merely a restatement of existing law allowing mail to be opened without a warrant in ''exigent circumstances'' to protect public safety.
''All this is saying is that there are provisions at law for, in exigent circumstances, for such inspections,'' Mr. Snow said. ''It has been thus. This is not a change in the law. This is not new.''
The questions arose after The New York Daily News published an article on Thursday drawing attention to the Dec. 20 signing statement and legal questions surrounding it. The front page featured a photo of Mr. Bush alongside the banner headline: ''Prez Goes Postal.''
Federal law, in keeping with the constitutional prohibition on unreasonable searches, generally prohibits the government from opening first-class mail without a warrant. But a 1996 postal provision allows postal inspectors to open mail without a warrant in narrow circumstances if there is credible evidence that a package contains a bomb or other dangerous material.
Mr. Bush has drawn intense scrutiny and criticism from Democrats and groups like the American Bar Association for issuing signing statements reserving the right to disregard more than 800 selected provisions of measures that he signed into law, often on the grounds that they represented an unconstitutional infringement on executive authority.
In signing the postal legislation last month, Mr. Bush said that its restrictions on opening mail should be construed ''in a manner consistent, to the maximum extent permissible, with the need to conduct searches in exigent circumstances, such as to protect human life and safety against hazardous materials, and the need for physical searches specifically authorized by law for foreign intelligence collection.''
Mr. Snow said Mr. Bush had not claimed any ''sweeping new powers'' through the statement, as The Daily News article asserted, and the Postal Service issued a statement on Thursday echoing that assessment.
''As has been the longstanding practice, first-class mail is protected from unreasonable search and seizure when in postal custody,'' said Thomas Day, a senior vice president for the Postal Service. ''Nothing in the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act changes this protection. The president is not exerting any new authority.''
Critics were not so certain.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, called Mr. Bush's signing statement a ''last-minute, irregular and unauthorized reinterpretation of a duly passed law'' protecting the privacy of mail users. The American Civil Liberties Union said it would press to find out how often mailings had been opened without warrants.

Responding to the shooting death of an unarmed Queens man by police officers nearly seven weeks ago, New York City's Police Department has commissioned a six-month independent review of its firearms training, of instances in which officers have fired their guns and of the phenomenon of so-called contagious shooting, the department's top official said yesterday.
The study, which police officials said was the first of its kind commissioned by the department, will be done by the RAND Corporation, a private nonprofit organization that has reviewed police practices in other major cities, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said. The announcement came amid continuing bitterness since the death of Sean Bell, who was killed in a hail of 50 police bullets in Jamaica, Queens, hours before his wedding on Nov. 25.

The study, which police officials said was the first of its kind commissioned by the department, will be done by the RAND Corporation, a private nonprofit organization that has reviewed police practices in other major cities, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said. The announcement came amid continuing bitterness since the death of Sean Bell, who was killed in a hail of 50 police bullets in Jamaica, Queens, hours before his wedding on Nov. 25.
''Questions have arisen as to the quality and effectiveness of our training'' Mr. Kelly said at a news conference. ''We thought it would be appropriate to bring in a recognized world-renowned nongovernment organization to take a look at all of our firearms training.''
Mr. Kelly said a team from RAND would assess five aspects of firearm use by police officers. They include initial, continuing and tactical firearms training, investigations of police-involved shootings, and situations in which shots fired by one officer spur other officers to shoot, a phenomenon that may have played a role in Mr. Bell's death.
The organization will delve into the details of shootings in which the police are involved, examining an officer's experience, the nature of the threat, the environment in which they fired their guns and other issues. Comparisons will be drawn to firearms training in other law enforcement agencies, Mr. Kelly said.
RAND will not be looking into the death of Mr. Bell, which is under review by a grand jury in Queens, Mr. Kelly said.
K. Jack Riley, the acting director of the RAND Center on Quality Policing, said the organization had previously evaluated training in the Los Angeles Police Department, investigated racial profiling among Oakland police officers, and examined ways to improve recruitment and retention among the police in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.
''This is a very proactive step the N.Y.P.D. is taking,'' Mr. Riley said. ''I think there is an honest interest in having a dispassionate third party take an objective look at their training, and see if there's anything they're not getting right -- or can improve -- with regards to firearms training.''
News of the New York study, which will cost about half a million dollars and be paid for by the New York City Police Foundation, a charity that supports the Police Department, drew mixed responses from experts in firearms and police tactics.
Thomas A. Reppetto, a former president of the Citizens Crime Commission, said that bringing in an outside organization like RAND would likely inspire more public confidence, which has wavered of late, than an in-house Police Department review would.
But Dean Speir, who writes about firearms and tactics, asked why the Police Department had not undertaken such a review before, citing the death of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed West African immigrant whom officers shot at 41 times. Another expert suggested that the money would be better spent on hands-on tactical training.
''If you talk to cops, they'll tell you people on the front line are starved for operational training,'' said Eugene O'Donnell, a professor of police studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
But Paul J. Browne, a spokesman for the department, said that one purpose of the review was to determine whether the current training needed to be revamped. He also noted that Mr. Kelly was not the police commissioner during the Diallo shooting.
''What the commissioner wants is an independent assessment,'' Mr. Browne said. ''If the training needs to be improved, he wants an independent assessment of what improvements are needed.''

One tucked photographs of two young constituents who had died fighting in Iraq inside the Bible he used to be sworn into office. Another held an open house in her new office here in the Capitol for the busload of supporters her staff invited from New York. And a third met with prominent liberals on a newly created ''bloggers' alley'' here and appeared on C-Span to introduce himself to a new national audience.
It was that kind of day for the crop of newly elected House members from the New York metropolitan region, as the 110th Congress convened on a largely ceremonial day that was filled with joy and awe.
Newly elected House members from the New York metropolitan region joined the 110th Congress on a largely ceremonial day.
One tucked photographs of two young constituents who had died fighting in Iraq inside the Bible he used to be sworn into office. Another held an open house in her new office here in the Capitol for the busload of supporters her staff invited from New York. And a third met with prominent liberals on a newly created ''bloggers' alley'' here and appeared on C-Span to introduce himself to a new national audience.
It was that kind of day for the crop of newly elected House members from the New York metropolitan region, as the 110th Congress convened on a largely ceremonial day that was filled with joy and awe.
''I didn't believe I had won on election night, and it's still barely real,'' said Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat who represents New York's 20th District, surrounding Albany, as she stood outside the House chamber after casting one of her first votes. ''There have been only so many members of Congress in the history of the United States.''
John Hall, the former singer with the band Orleans and a Democrat who captured the 19th Congressional District seat in New York City's northern suburbs, was similarly struck. ''It's exciting and it's humbling,'' he said, as he stood in line waiting to attend a ceremonial swearing-in at the Rayburn Room in the Capitol with the new speaker, Nancy Pelosi.
It was a day that promised to usher in a new direction for the nation, as Democrats took control of Congress for the last two years of President Bush's term. The day also involved the largest number of new faces in recent memory for the House delegations from the New York region.
In the November election, Democrats picked up at least five seats in New York and Connecticut, taking one open seat and defeating four incumbents who had been hobbled by their party's problems, chief among them President Bush's lagging popularity.
Democrats predicted that the power shift here would almost certainly enhance the fortunes of the New York region, a Democratic bastion whose entreaties for federal aid frequently fell on deaf ears in a Congress dominated by conservative Republicans from other regions.
In all, 34 of the 47 House members from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are Democrats (and the Republicans tend to be moderates whose positions on social issues like abortion have long put them at odds with conservative leaders of their party and thus less able to help their areas, even when their party was in power).
As Representative Nita M. Lowey, among the most influential members of the region's House delegation, put it on Thursday: ''We have been waiting for this moment a long time. We are in a position to deliver.''
Among the new members at the Capitol on Thursday was Joseph Courtney, who defeated a Republican incumbent, Rob Simmons, by slightly more than 80 votes in the Second District, in eastern Connecticut. As he waited for the ceremonial swearing-in, he clutched a 65-year-old Bible that belonged to his father. Inside it were photographs of two soldiers he knew who died in Iraq. He said he took the photos with him as a reminder of the awesome responsibility he was about to undertake.
There were jubilant celebrations across Washington, including a reception at the Rayburn Office Building for Mr. Courtney and another newcomer from Connecticut, Christopher S. Murphy, who defeated Nancy L. Johnson, a 12-term Republican incumbent, in the Fifth District, in the state's northwestern corner.
It was packed with gleeful supporters who came from Connecticut and munched on cheese and fruit, But the political significance of the day was not lost on Mr. Murphy, who ran on a platform of restoring ethics in Washington. He recalled walking past scaffolding as he entered the Capitol on Thursday morning and said that it reminded him of the enormous work that overhauling the ethos of Washington would entail for him and the other freshman lawmakers.
''Every one of us came down here with a little different background and mandate,'' he mused. ''But I think the unifying theme of this freshman class is to change the culture and tone of this place,'' Mr. Murphy said.
''We are here at a critical moment in our history,'' said Mr. Courtney, who has been critical of President Bush's handling of the war and who noted that he owed his own victory to voter disenchantment with the war. ''We have a huge challenge ahead of us.''

For a half-century, the blue oval logo atop Ford Motor's headquarters has served as a kind of beacon for the American automobile industry, a signpost for local motorists on area highways and a guidepost for pilots landing at Detroit's airport nearby.
But lately, blue is the only word for the malaise surrounding Ford, which is rapidly seeing its position in the industry and in its hometown eroded by its failure to combat foreign competition.
Ford has rapidly seen its position in the auto industry and in its hometown eroded by its failure to combat foreign competition.
For a half-century, the blue oval logo atop Ford Motor's headquarters has served as a kind of beacon for the American automobile industry, a signpost for local motorists on area highways and a guidepost for pilots landing at Detroit's airport nearby.
But lately, blue is the only word for the malaise surrounding Ford, which is rapidly seeing its position in the industry and in its hometown eroded by its failure to combat foreign competition.
This year, Ford expects to permanently lose its grip on second place in the American market to Toyota, which passed it twice in monthly sales in the last six months, including December. As many as half its blue- and white-collar employees have decided to take voluntary buyouts from a company where jobs were long seen as lifetime guarantees.
Ron Cimino, 44, used to regret not landing a job at Ford, where his father worked for 52 years. Turned down in 1984 because he lacked a master's degree, Mr. Cimino of Dearborn wound up starting his own import-export business.
''I'm glad I didn't end up working at Ford,'' he said. ''I never thought I'd say that.''
To be sure, General Motors and Chrysler have their own problems that are weighing on this city. Their headquarters are here, too, as are some of their car plants, and thousands of their employees have their own worries as each company struggles financially.
But Ford's troubles, arguably, are felt more acutely here. After all, G.M. placed a good bulk of its manufacturing 60 miles north, in Flint, Mich., and once had factories from Massachusetts to California as well as the Midwest. Chrysler, though still a big local employer, has had German owners for nearly a decade.
Ford, by contrast, is woven more into the fabric of Detroit, with the Ford name on office buildings, museums, high schools and highways, as well as the football stadium, Ford Field, which opened downtown in 2002.
Now, as the annual Detroit auto show prepares to open to the media this weekend, much of this city's bedrock is unexpectedly at risk. In November, Ford disclosed it had pledged nearly all its assets, including the trademark on its 100-year-old logo, as collateral against $25 billion in loans needed to fund its restructuring.
Ford has generated a particular sense of sympathy, bewilderment and fear here that its crosstown rivals have not. There is sympathy, analysts say, because more of a human element is involved, namely the Ford family; puzzlement because Ford seemed to be the one Detroit auto company that had an answer for Japanese competition in the 1980s and 1990s with its profitable sport utility vehicles; and fear that if a once-powerful company like Ford could falter, no one in Detroit may be safe.
The sentiment is readily voiced in places like Miller's Bar, where the red leather barstools and colored Christmas lights evoke the watering hole in ''It's A Wonderful Life.'' It has been a Dearborn gathering spot since 1941.
''Dearborn,'' said the owner, Mark Miller, ''is Ford.''
Judy Dolan, a secretary for the Detroit Building Trades Council, said during an interview at her home, ''I feel horrible about the situation they're in.'' She drives only Ford vehicles in support of her hometown company.
Concern over Ford's future bubbled up late last month in conversation at the holiday cocktail parties held by the Detroit and foreign car companies and their parts suppliers.
Given the attention to Ford's situation, the company's new chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, who arrived in September from the Boeing Company, is already recognized wherever he goes.
Mr. Mulally said in an interview that he was recently lost in a local supermarket when another shopper came up to him.
''Oh, Mr. Mulally, we're so glad you're here,'' he recalled her saying, before she helped him find shampoo.
His predecessor was William Clay Ford Jr., who became the face of the company in television ads over the last four years as he struggled to fix Ford's problems (he remains chairman).
The family is the reason many company employees past and present refer to the automaker as Ford's. It is not a grammatical error, as visitors here might assume, but a nod to the fact that it is a company built by the original Henry and all the Fords that followed him.
''The Fords have a relationship with the American people,'' said James P. Womack, the author and expert in manufacturing efficiency who advised Mr. Mulally at Boeing.
They include Kevin Boyle's retired father, also named Kevin, who immigrated to Dearborn from Ireland in the 1950s, drawn by the chance to work for a company founded by the most famous man in the auto business.
''People came to Detroit with an intense connection with that name, and then their lives became tied up with that name,'' said Mr. Boyle, a professor of history at Ohio State who has written extensively about the automobile industry. ''It was a badge of honor to work for Ford.''
Numerous families here boast multiple generations of Ford employees, some who worked on the assembly line, others -- fathers and sons, mothers and daughters -- who toiled in company offices. ''I started there when I was 19, and my whole family worked there,'' said Karen Kenniburg, who manages the vehicles driven by Ford executives.
The Fords, for their part, have given back, not just in jobs but also in charities. Guests at a Nissan holiday party last month at the New Detroit Science Center drank wine and munched crab cakes beneath a wall of donors dotted with names of various Fords. The same was true for Honda, whose event took place in an atrium outside Orchestra Hall.
That seeming omnipresence, however, makes the departures from Ford more poignant. Last month, more than 30,000 blue-collar workers accepted deals to give up their jobs.
About half were ready to retire, but the rest were workers who did not have enough seniority to begin drawing pensions. They accepted payments of up to $140,000 apiece to leave.
Ford's white-collar employees are not exempt. The company has already cut 4,000 managers, and 10,000 more are set to go by spring. Last month, one of every three salaried employees was called in by their boss to be told Ford was giving them the opportunity for a buyout. If they did not accept, their jobs might not be safe, some were told.
Altogether, more than 45,000 people, or half the number employed by the company at the beginning of the year, will not be working at Ford in 2007.
That is likely to hurt business at Miller's Bar, where 60 percent of the patrons work for Ford, and 18 of 25 cars in the parking lot on a recent afternoon bore Ford logos.
Others will be affected, as well. At a Starbucks on Michigan Avenue, a mile away from Ford's headquarters, and once a hangout for Mr. Ford, one customer, Shelley Boda, 32, said she was unable to land a job at the company, where her father, grandfather and numerous relatives worked.
Instead, she chose the health care field, now less of a safe haven than she had hoped. With Ford cutting so many jobs, and the rich benefits that went with them, ''there won't be anyone here who can afford health care,'' she said.
Professor Boyle said Ford employees and the community were now realizing that what they thought was a ''safe bet'' was not.
''The funny thing is, people didn't see it as a bet,'' he said. ''You would have parents who worked the line and have enough to send kids to college. They would go off and get engineering degrees, marketing degrees and work for the companies.
''That has crumbled. There are few things more terrifying than that.''
And yet, many still believe in the power of the Fords themselves to save their company. Ms. Kenniburg said they gave Ford an advantage over G.M. and Chrysler as they devise a comeback plan.
''The Ford family,'' she said, ''they're going to do everything in their power to keep this company going.''

Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo said Thursday that his office would review thousands of individual grants known as ''member items,'' the spending Albany lawmakers doled out for pet projects last year, staking out a potentially vast new front in efforts to reform the ways of the state capital.

Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo said Thursday that his office would review thousands of individual grants known as ''member items,'' the spending Albany lawmakers doled out for pet projects last year, staking out a potentially vast new front in efforts to reform the ways of the state capital.
And moving to confront corruption in the upper echelons of state government, Mr. Cuomo also said he would promote the chief of his office's public integrity unit to special deputy attorney general, and promised a significant increase in the unit's staffing and resources.
In a brief but pointed speech here Thursday at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, Mr. Cuomo assailed the member-item spending as ''a visible, graphic illustration'' of the profligacy, secrecy and dysfunction that have characterized state government and dismayed voters in recent years.
Last month, federal prosecutors accused State Senator Efrain González Jr., a Bronx Democrat, of stealing more than $400,000 in state money appropriated for charities in his district and using it for personal expenses. Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader of the State Senate, is facing a federal investigation into some $500,000 in state grants he directed to Evident Technologies, a profit-making technology company in which a close friend of his was an investor.
Mr. Cuomo said that his office would review more than 6,000 member items that were approved last year to ensure that they met legal requirements for the spending of taxpayer money, and move to recover any state funds that were spent inappropriately. All future member items will face the same review, he said.
Taking a cue from Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who has also made ethics reform the top priority for his term, Mr. Cuomo cast his effort as the Statehouse version of the financial-services prosecutions that made Mr. Spitzer famous when he served as attorney general.
''As attorney general, Eliot Spitzer was successful in changing the way we did business on Wall Street,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''Now our challenge is to change the way we do business on State Street,'' he said, referring to the thoroughfare that runs alongside the Capitol.
Dick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union, a government watchdog group, said he and others would welcome the review.
''Cuomo's push to ensure that there is merit and accountability behind the doling out of member items is a nice way to end a reform-filled week in Albany,'' Mr. Dadey said.
Called member items because many are proposed by individual members of the Legislature, the grants have a long but not always illustrious history in New York. The grants are distributed by both the Legislature and the governor, and many have been directed to the kinds of programs that traditionally attract government aid, such as legal services for the poor or AIDS education efforts.
Other grants, however, have gone to fix up private hunting clubs and to the clubhouses used by ethnic fraternal organizations, like an Italian-American war veterans post that got money to make improvements to its kitchen.
The grants were once listed individually in the state's budget, where they could be examined by other legislators and the public. But in 1999, when then-Gov. George E. Pataki used his line-item veto to eliminate many items requested by Democratic lawmakers, the items were gathered into a lump sum, making them impossible to review and difficult to control. The more than 6,000 items in the last budget totaled about $200 million.
In his State of the State address on Wednesday, Governor Spitzer proposed that member items once again be listed in the budget individually, a step that both Mr. Bruno and Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the State Assembly, say they support.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Silver said Thursday that the speaker welcomed Mr. Cuomo's plans.
Under the state's Constitution, any program that receives state money must have a public purpose. The exact definition of ''public purpose,'' however, is the product of a multitude of legal decisions stretching back decades, and is relatively broad.
''It would turn on what the actual use of the money is, but the presumption, if it went to a not-for-profit or a government, is that it's basically for a public purpose,'' Mr. Cuomo said. He also said that he thought a majority of member items served worthwhile purposes, and that he could not think of a member item that has in the past been found by courts or the attorney general's office not to have a public purpose.
Mr. Cuomo did not say whether he thought Mr. Bruno's grants to Evident Technologies would merit any action by his office, citing the federal investigation. ''At the conclusion of the criminal investigation, we will make our determination,'' he said.

New York State elections officials said on Thursday that they would consider suspending the testing of new voting machines in the state, after learning that the laboratory hired to perform the tests was temporarily barred by federal authorities last summer from accrediting new state voting systems.
The company, Ciber Inc. of Greenwood Village, Colo., is among the nation's top testers of voting machines. Ciber has a $3 million contract to help New York test proposed systems from five manufacturers to replace its aging lever machines.
The laboratory hired to perform the tests was barred by federal authorities last summer from accrediting new state voting systems.
New York State elections officials said on Thursday that they would consider suspending the testing of new voting machines in the state, after learning that the laboratory hired to perform the tests was temporarily barred by federal authorities last summer from accrediting new state voting systems.
The company, Ciber Inc. of Greenwood Village, Colo., is among the nation's top testers of voting machines. Ciber has a $3 million contract to help New York test proposed systems from five manufacturers to replace its aging lever machines.
Officials at the federal Election Assistance Commission delayed accrediting Ciber in July, after detecting problems in Ciber's quality-control procedures. The company has long been criticized by voting watchdog groups, but some state elections officials said on Thursday that they learned of the federal commission's decision only after details of it were published Thursday in The New York Times.
''If we had known that, and if we had seen the report from them, we would have known why they were decertified, and maybe we wouldn't have hired them to begin with, or maybe we would have made some remedial changes,'' said Lee K. Daghlian, a spokesman for the New York State Board of Elections.
Mr. Daghlian said the board had requested a copy of a report prepared by the federal commission and would review it before making a final decision.
''It may not delay use of the new machines,'' he said. ''If this report comes in and it's something really bad that we didn't know about, we may have to start all over again.''
A spokeswoman for Ciber could not be reached for comment.
The potential delay was the latest setback for New York's efforts to comply with federal requirements that states modernize their voting systems to deal with concerns stemming from the 2000 election. The state has faced sanctions from the federal government for failing to comply with the new federal standards, which required new voting machines by last fall's elections.
Since the state board established new and stringent voting machine standards in April, the process for acquiring new machines had been continually delayed, in part because machines being tested have failed to meet the new standards, said Bo Lipari, executive director of New Yorkers for Verified Voting, a state voting watchdog group.
Ciber has also been criticized by a second company, Nystec, which was hired to oversee Ciber's efforts.
''I think what we're seeing now corroborates what Nystec has been saying, and that is that Ciber is not up to the task of testing voting systems in a way that protects the interests of voters,'' Mr. Lipari said.

Vincent Sardi Jr., who owned and managed Sardi's restaurant, his father's theater-district landmark, for more than half a century and became, by wide agreement, the unofficial mayor of Broadway, died yesterday at a hospital in Berlin, Vt.. He was 91 and had lived in Warren, Vt., since retiring in 1997.
The cause was complications of a urinary tract infection, said Sean Ricketts, a grandson and manager at the restaurant.
Vincent Sardi Jr. owned and managed the theater-district landmark for more than half a century.
Vincent Sardi Jr., who owned and managed Sardi's restaurant, his father's theater-district landmark, for more than half a century and became, by wide agreement, the unofficial mayor of Broadway, died yesterday at a hospital in Berlin, Vt.. He was 91 and had lived in Warren, Vt., since retiring in 1997.
The cause was complications of a urinary tract infection, said Sean Ricketts, a grandson and manager at the restaurant.
Mr. Sardi ran one of the world's most famous restaurants, a Broadway institution as central to the life of the theater as actors, agents and critics. It was, the press agent Richard Maney once wrote, ''the club, mess hall, lounge, post office, saloon and marketplace of the people of the theater.''
Mr. Sardi understood theater people, loved them and was loved in return. He carried out-of-work actors, letting them run up a tab until their ship came in. (At one point, Sardi's maintained 600 such accounts.)
He attended every show and made sure his headwaiters did the same, so that they could recognize even bit players and make a fuss over them. At times, he exercised what he called ''a fine Italian hand,'' seating a hungry actor near a producer with a suitable part to cast.
He commiserated with his patrons when a show failed, and rejoiced with them when the critics were kind. He distributed favors, theater tickets and food, rode on horseback with the local police, and acted as a spokesman, official and unofficial, for the theater district.
Mr. Sardi was born on July 23, 1915, in Manhattan and spent his early childhood in a railroad flat on West 56th Street, where his parents took in show-business boarders. In 1921, his father took over a basement restaurant in a brownstone at 246 West 44th Street. He named it the Little Restaurant, but theater people called it Sardi's, and so it became.
The family lived upstairs. When the building was razed in 1927 to make way for the St. James Theater, Sardi's moved to its current location, at 234 West 44th.
Vincent Jr., whom his father called Cino, attended Holy Cross Academy on 43rd Street. He got a taste of the theater at an early age, appearing as Pietro, an Italian urchin, in ''The Master of the Inn'' at the Little Theater when he was 10. The play closed quickly, but not before Vincent learned about the subtleties of the actor-director relationship. When he pointed out that an Italian would say ''addio,'' not ''adios,'' he was told to keep his opinions to himself and read the line as written.
In 1926, the Sardis moved to Flushing, Queens, where Vincent graduated from Flushing High School. He entered Columbia University intending to become a doctor, but failed the chemistry examination, in part because, short of pocket money, he had sold his textbook at Barnes & Noble so he could attend a dance. He transferred to Columbia Business School and earned a degree in 1937.
In the meantime, he began working in the family business on weekends, earning $14 a week. ''My duties included stints at the cigarette counter, shifts at the cash register and a few attempts at being a Saturday headwaiter in the upstairs second-floor level,'' he recalled in Playbill.
He also learned how to cater to Sardi's unusual clientele. When Broderick Crawford was appearing in ''Of Mice and Men,'' Vincent was volunteered to take the actor's Doberman for its nightly walk.
Mr. Sardi spent two years learning the food-service business at the Ritz-Carlton before rejoining Sardi's in 1939 as dining-room captain. That year he married Carolyn Euiller. The marriage ended in 1946.
In 1942 he joined the Marine Corps, which took one look at his résumé and assigned him to run the bachelor officers' mess at the Cherry Point Air Station in North Carolina. The next year he was sent to Okinawa, where he supervised a rest camp. He left the Marines as a captain. In 1946, he married Adelle Rasey, an actress. That marriage, too, ended in divorce.
In 1947 Vincent Sr. retired, and Vincent Jr. took over the restaurant, buying it from his father. Sardi's was already renowned as a place where deals were made, gossip circulated and actors and producers made it their business to see and be seen. ''The restaurant had a central place in the theater,'' said Gerald Schoenfeld, the president of the Shubert Organization. ''You could walk in at lunch and do a day's business, see people you hadn't seen in a long time. You didn't think of going anywhere else.''
Mr. Sardi, a tall, affable man with a military bearing, perfected the art of seating enemies far apart and putting friends and potential allies near one another. ''He was always the soul of politesse, but where he seated you could be crucial to making a deal,'' said the producer Arthur Cantor.
Mr. Sardi also knew how to keep temperamental actors happy. ''You've got to be awfully careful with actors out of work,'' he told an interviewer. ''They're very sensitive about their fading prestige, and I know darn well they scrimp to come in here, on the chance that they'll be considered for a part. Boosting an actor's ego with a table in a good location is simply my way of giving him a pat on the back.''
When he was not running the restaurant, Mr. Sardi raced cars, played polo and skied. He was also president of the Greater Times Square Committee in the 1960s and the Restaurant League of New York in the 1970s.
If Sardi's was a club, its rules were mysterious. Only Mr. Sardi knew them, and only he could explain why, for many years, one of the best tables was held for Mr. and Mrs. Ira Katzenberg. The Katzenbergs, who by the early 1950s had attended virtually every Broadway opening for 30 years, took their seats at Sardi's at 7:15 and ordered, without fail, a brandy and a bottle of Saratoga water. Mr. Sardi called them his favorite customers.
''People like them keep the theater alive, and the theater is their life,'' he said. ''The least we can do is give them the best table in the house.''
Mr. Sardi could do nothing about the autograph hounds and the photographers who crowded around the entrance. But inside the front doors, his word was law. Diners were not to be disturbed.
Sardi's shone brightest on the opening night of a Broadway show, and in the 1960s, a show opened nearly every night. The ritual never varied. In a line that stretched down 44th Street, theatergoers, theater insiders and celebrity watchers clamored for a table, hoping against hope to be seated on the first floor, where they could see cast members, producers and the playwright of the moment entering the restaurant after the curtain rang down. As the actors made their way to their tables, the diners would stand and applaud.
Once seated, the actors, producers and playwright would put on a brave face waiting for the reviews. The first 25 copies of The New York Times and The New York Herald Tribune were rushed over to Sardi's from the printing presses at midnight, with the review pages marked. Mr. Sardi would man the telephone, taking calls from friends of the cast, ticket brokers and newspaper columnists eager to get a read on the fate of the new play. If the reviews were poor, a pall descended over the dining room, and diners would slink out the door. If the reviews were good, it was Champagne all around and a celebration until the wee hours.
''All of us on the staff were caught up in each Broadway play,'' Mr. Sardi wrote in Playbill. ''We became involved in the raising of money, the casting of roles, the progress of rehearsals, and, after opening night, the success or failure of a play.''
In 1946, hoping to capture some of the excitement of Sardi's, the radio station WOR created ''Luncheon at Sardi's,'' an hourlong program in which the host moved from table to table, microphone in hand, interviewing celebrities. In 1949, the show spawned a television spinoff, ''Dinner at Sardi's,'' which failed to catch fire. The celebrities had a bad habit of using their air time for shameless self-promotion.
Undeterred, Mr. Sardi appeared as himself in two television dramas in the mid-50s, ''Catch a Falling Star,'' on ''Robert Montgomery Presents,'' and ''Now, Where Was I?'' a CBS production. He also turned out a cookbook, ''Curtain Up at Sardi's'' (1957), which he wrote with Helen Bryson. It included, of course, the restaurant's signature dish, cannelloni with Sardi sauce, a homey curiosity in which French crepes were stuffed with ground chicken, ground beef, spinach and Parmesan cheese, then topped with a velouté sauce enhanced with Hollandaise, sherry and whipped cream.
By the late 1950s, Sardi's was grossing about $1 million a year, and in 1958, looking to expand, Mr. Sardi opened Sardi's East, at 123 East 54th Street.
Mr. Sardi threw his all into the new venture. He arranged for theatergoers to be taken to Broadway on a London double-decker bus. He hired out-of-work actors as conductors. He lured his father out of retirement and installed him as manager. Sardi's East never caught on, however, and Mr. Sardi sold it in 1968.
By the 1960s, the Times Square area was deteriorating, the theater district was becoming more dangerous and the vibrant world of culture that had nourished Sardi's entered a period of decline. To make matters worse, in 1974, Mr. Sardi embarked on a ruinous venture, opening a 700-seat dinner theater in Franklin Square, on Long Island. The theater burned money for two years before closing.
At Sardi's, critics complained, standards seemed to be slipping. ''Those who go to the restaurant to observe celebrities will rarely be disappointed,'' Mimi Sheraton wrote in a 1981 review for The Times. ''Those who go for good food that is well served will rarely be satisfied.''
Gradually, Sardi's became a tourist destination. The lunchtime business evaporated. The restaurant was showing its age. In September 1985, Mr. Sardi sold it for $6.2 million to two producers from Detroit, Ivan Bloch and Harvey Klaris, and the restaurateur Stuart Lichtenstein. They announced plans to bring back the old luster and open up a Sardi's restaurant, hotel and casino in Atlantic City. Instead, they fell behind on payments, declared bankruptcy and closed the restaurant in June 1990.
Mr. Sardi, who had planned to spend a tranquil retirement in Vermont, resumed ownership of Sardi's in 1991. He gave it a facelift, leaving intact the 700 or so caricatures of theater people that hang on the walls. He also brought in serious chefs, who gradually improved the quality of the food, although Sardi's, even in its heyday, never owed its reputation to its kitchen. As his health declined, Mr. Sardi spent less and less time at the restaurant, turning its operation over to his partner, Max Klimavicius, who will continue to run the business, a restaurant spokesman said yesterday.
Mr. Sardi is survived by his wife, the former June Keller; three children, Paul, of Coco Beach, Fla.; David, of San Diego; and Tabitha, of Manhattan; a sister, Anne Gina Sardi of Stamford, Conn.; nine grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. A daughter, Jennifer, died earlier.
The family plans to hold a memorial service at a date to be announced but at a location that is certain: Sardi's.

In what appears to be the first exchange with a journalist since going into hiding five years ago, the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, said that he had not seen Al Qaeda's chief, Osama bin Laden, in five years and that he would never negotiate with the United States-backed government of Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan. He also threatened to continue the war until foreign troops withdraw from Afghanistan.
The statements were made in written response to questions sent by e-mail to the Taliban spokesman, Muhammad Hanif, who often speaks to journalists by telephone from an undisclosed location. Mr. Hanif said that Mullah Omar had written the replies himself and that a courier had returned the answers on a USB computer drive.
Mullah Muhammad Omar’s statements appear to be the first exchange with a journalist since going into hiding five years ago.
In what appears to be the first exchange with a journalist since going into hiding five years ago, the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, said that he had not seen Al Qaeda's chief, Osama bin Laden, in five years and that he would never negotiate with the United States-backed government of Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan. He also threatened to continue the war until foreign troops withdraw from Afghanistan.
The statements were made in written response to questions sent by e-mail to the Taliban spokesman, Muhammad Hanif, who often speaks to journalists by telephone from an undisclosed location. Mr. Hanif said that Mullah Omar had written the replies himself and that a courier had returned the answers on a USB computer drive.
Though it was impossible to verify those claims, the statements, if authentic, would be Mullah Omar's first exchange with a journalist since he was driven from power in 2001 by the American-led invasion of Afghanistan. The fugitive Taliban leader, who claims to be at large in Afghanistan, is widely thought to have taken up sanctuary in Pakistan.
Since fleeing his last stronghold in the southern city of Kandahar in December 2001, Mullah Omar said that he had not seen or tried to contact Mr. bin Laden, and that although his movement did not have a specific alliance with Al Qaeda, they were fighting for the same goals.
''I have neither seen him nor have made any effort to do so, but I pray for his health and safety,'' he said of Mr. bin Laden. ''We have never felt the need for a permanent relationship in the present circumstances. But they have set jihad as their goal, whereas we have set the expulsion of American troops from Afghanistan as our target. This is the common goal of all the Muslims.''
Asked about the suicide bombers who have carried out over 100 attacks in Afghanistan in the last year, he said they were acting on religious orders from the Taliban. ''The mujahedeen do not take any action without a fatwa,'' he said, meaning an Islamic edict. ''They seek fatwas before they take any action in their self-defense.''
He denied receiving any outside assistance, and dismissed as Western propaganda that Pakistan was providing assistance and a safe haven to his movement. ''We have not received any assistance so far, nor can anybody prove that,'' he said. ''The leadership, resistance and shura are all based here in Afghanistan.''
He dismissed Mr. Karzai's effort to convene a grand assembly between Afghan and Pakistani elders and leading representatives to try to forge peace between the nations as a conspiracy by American intelligence agencies. ''Only those people who have sold out to foreign forces will participate,'' he said. ''Our participation is absolutely out of question.''
''First of all, foreign troops should leave Afghanistan and then the institutions they have created should be dismantled,'' he said. ''Unless that happens, the war will heat up further. It will not decrease.''
''The people themselves have risen up to fight the Americans,'' the statement continued. ''Nobody can tolerate this kind of subjugation and sacrilege of their culture and religion. It would be humiliating for anybody to think that the nation does not want to evict American forces. No nation can accept the dictates of a handful of dollar-greedy and treacherous people.''
In his replies, he showed himself unrepentant for his refusal to give up Mr. bin Laden to the United States after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and for blowing up the giant Buddhas of Bamiyan in March 2001.
''Our stand to grant refuge to Osama bin Laden was based on principles,'' he said. ''If there were people who were opposed to us giving refuge to him, they should have done so with logic and reason, and not using bullying or threats,'' he said. The council of clerics, which was the highest authority of the Taliban government, asked Mr. bin Laden to leave, but never had any intention to force him out, he said. ''The clerics had declared jihad against the United States in total opposition to his surrender to the Americans,'' he said.
Asked if the Buddhas' destruction was a mistake in retrospect, he said: ''Shariah is Shariah. There is no distinction on whether a certain thing is difficult or easy. A certain number of Muslims have been influenced by other civilizations, and that's why they seem to find Islamic injunctions too difficult.'' Shariah is the legal code of Islam based on the Koran.
He repeated the same justification that his government had used previously for its harsh strictures that closed girls' schools and forbade women to work, namely that his government was still fighting a war and could not do everything at once.
''Girls' schools were either too few or were nonexistent before we took over,'' he said. ''We were preparing a strategy for girls' education in accordance with the Shariah.''
He blamed the anti-Taliban forces of the Northern Alliance and international sanctions for preventing his government from achieving its aims.
''We could have formed a real government had we achieved full and total control over the whole country, and we did manage to run the government in an organized manner with the blessing of Shariah and divine laws,'' he said. ''But if there were problems, those were largely because of the conspiracies of the infidels and foreign enemies, for instance, the impositions of sanctions on Taliban, organizing anti-Taliban forces and preparing them to fight the mujahedeen.''

The two men first saw the baby from across the Bronx street, dangling from a fire escape four stories above the sidewalk. His grip was growing weaker by the second. The two men saw only one choice: run over and try to catch him.
They positioned themselves below, arms out. The little boy fell. He glanced off a branch of a tree that was brushing against the fire escape. Then he bounced off the chest of one of the men, who was knocked off balance and could not grab him.
Two longtime friends became the second and third good Samaritans of the new year, not even a week old.
The two men first saw the baby from across the Bronx street, dangling from a fire escape four stories above the sidewalk. His grip was growing weaker by the second. The two men saw only one choice: run over and try to catch him.
They positioned themselves below, arms out. The little boy fell. He glanced off a branch of a tree that was brushing against the fire escape. Then he bounced off the chest of one of the men, who was knocked off balance and could not grab him.
But he landed safely in the arms of the other man, who managed to hold on tight.
And so yesterday, the two men -- longtime friends who had been looking over a used Honda that one was thinking of selling and the other was thinking of buying -- became the second and third good Samaritans of the new year, not even a week old. The rescue came two days after another New Yorker flung himself onto the subway tracks to save a 20-year-old film student who had fallen from the platform.
''This is a week of heroes here in New York,'' Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said later yesterday.
The two men -- Julio Gonzalez, 43, a mechanic who lives in the neighborhood, and Pedro Nevarez, 40, of Corona, Queens -- insisted that they had just done the obvious thing. As Mr. Nevarez, who has a 19-year-old foster son, put it: ''I'm not a hero. I did what any other father would do. When you're a father, you would do this whether it's your child or not.''
By then, a crowd of reporters and residents of the East Tremont neighborhood was swirling around them, and someone said, ''If you're not a hero, how about an angel without wings?''
Mr. Nevarez simply smiled. Mr. Gonzalez said, ''I feel I did something good.''
The baby, identified by the police as Timothy Addo, 3, was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital, where he was treated for minor scrapes and was released, a hospital spokesman said.
Before long, a man who said he was Timothy's great-uncle returned from the hospital to the apartment building at 2105 Daly Avenue, near East 180th Street, and showed the crowd a photograph of Timothy after his tumble, taken with a cellphone. The boy had what appeared to be a bandage on his head, but looked as if he was enjoying the attention. The police said that Timothy had been in his baby sitter's apartment on the top floor of the five-story building, and that there were no window guards. He crawled onto a radiator and from there, onto the fire escape, they said.
Last night at the 48th Precinct station house, the police were questioning the baby sitter, identified by law enforcement officials as Carol Baldwin, 50. It was not clear if any charges would be filed against her.
Ricky Serra, 31, said his daughter Alesha, 1 1/2, was also in Ms. Baldwin's apartment when Timothy climbed out the window. Ms. Baldwin also watches Mr. Serra's 4-year-old daughter, Adriana, after school. He said he would not send the girls back to her.
''That could have been my baby,'' he said, referring to Timothy. But he added that Ms. Baldwin could not have foreseen that Timothy would play with the window.
Timothy's mother, Katrina Cosme, 26, was at work when the boy clambered out the window. Going step by step on the fire escape, he managed to work his way down one floor as passers-by below took notice.
Some screamed for help. Mr. Gonzalez and Mr. Nevarez sprang into action, dashing toward the fire escape even though Mr. Gonzalez was not sure that the little object on the fire escape was a child. ''I thought it was a toy or something,'' he said later.
At first, he told Mr. Nevarez to run inside the building and pull the child back in. But the door was locked. Mr. Gonzalez realized that there was no time, and called his friend back. Mr. Nevarez said he tried to grab the bottom rung of the fire escape, hoping to climb up and carry the baby into the building. But the fire escape was too far off the ground.
They took their places under the fire escape just as Timothy lost his grip. Mr. Nevarez said Mr. Gonzalez told him: ''Stay right next to me. We're not going to let him hit the floor.''
First, the boy bounced off Mr. Nevarez. He said Timothy knocked the wind out of him, and also knocked him down.
Mr. Gonzalez then realized that it was up to him. ''I just hoped and prayed that I would be able to catch him,'' he said.
He did. ''He came down hard,'' Mr. Nevarez said. ''He only weighed 45 pounds, but it felt like he weighed more than a hundred.'' They wrapped him in Mr. Nevarez's jacket and waited for help to arrive.
A neighbor, Migdalia Melendez, 43, said that Ms. Baldwin, the baby sitter, was standing behind the ambulance as the paramedics closed the doors, and that Timothy reached for her. Ms. Melendez said Ms. Baldwin put her arms around Timothy and said, ''I was only in the bathroom for a second.''
Ms. Melendez said she had been in her living room on the second floor when she heard people screaming and saw Timothy on the fire escape. She ran outside, as did her husband, Luis.
''Don't blame the baby sitter,'' he said. ''She's a good woman.''
Another neighbor, Kyiesha Johnson, 19, said that she had known Ms. Baldwin from childhood and that Ms. Baldwin had looked after children in the building for years. If parents had to go to the store, Ms. Johnson said, the baby sitter kept tabs on their children.
''She always tended to the kids perfect,'' Ms. Johnson said.
Timothy's mother, Ms. Cosme, arrived at the building a couple of hours after the excitement. She hugged Mr. Gonzalez and cut through the crowd. Last night, she told television reporters that she was grateful.
After the police arrived, Mr. Gonzalez and Mr. Nevarez gave each other a high-five. That was when Mr. Nevarez realized that his hand was sore from landing on it when he was knocked down. His chest also felt sore. But he decided that he did not need medical help.
He and Mr. Gonzalez have known each other since they were 9 and 6, respectively, Mr. Nevarez said. They grew up on 174th Street in the Mount Eden section of the Bronx and have kept in close touch over the years.
''We were in the right place at the right time,'' Mr. Nevarez said. ''If we hadn't been there, we'd be talking about how the kid across the street fell out of the house and died.''

Since then, neighbors have complained that the rubble-strewn, 1.5-acre site on 42nd Street, between Dyer and 10th Avenues, has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes in the summer and cockroaches, rats and other vermin year-round.
In the latest skirmish, Fred Papert, who built Theater Row nearby, filed a lawsuit yesterday against the developer, Stephen M. Ross, chief executive of Related Companies, saying the site had become an eyesore.
Mr. Ross appears to be considering a new plan for the site, possibly with a hotel, luxury apartments and shops. The plan also includes two small theaters that community groups and leaders want.
After meeting with elected officials in December to discuss complaints about the site, the developer installed floodlights along the blue construction fence on 42nd Street and periodically picked up the wind-swept garbage around the parcel.
But the problem has gotten to the point where it is cutting into business, said Glenn Isaacs, the manager of the Travel Inn, west of Related's site, and the owner of the Theater Row Diner, at Dyer Avenue and 42nd Street. ''Our hotel guests are coming back to the hotel saying it's dangerous,'' Mr. Isaacs said. ''There's rats, mice, garbage all over the place.''
Yesterday, a worker was pumping the stagnant rainwater that gathers in an eight-foot-deep hole on the site into a nearby sewer drain. The city's health and buildings departments found a series of violations last year relating to water that accumulates every time it rains. Some residents call the site ''Lake Related.''
Mr. Papert's lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, involves more than a dollop of revenge from a figure who was Mr. Ross's ally in acquiring the parcel. It seeks $500,000 in damages and says that the health and safety conditions at the Related site, which sits ''at the epicenter of a renewed and thriving neighborhood,'' are hurting the whole community and undermining property values.
A new plan could be in the works for the site. According to a real estate executive who has been briefed on the developer's plans, Related wants to form a joint venture with an unnamed hotel operator to build a 60-story, one-million-square-foot tower. The tower, with a hotel and luxury apartments at the top, would sit above shops, an Equinox gym and a couple of small theaters.
But Jeff T. Blau, the president of Related, said ''there's no deal at the moment.''
He added, ''We're exploring everything, given the Cirque deal not happening.''
He said he had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment.
The city and the community wanted Related to replace the two Off Broadway theaters it had demolished. ''Nothing would make us happier than if Related did what they originally promised us they would do,'' said Mr. Papert, president of the 42nd Street Development Corporation. ''The minute we know it's going to happen, we'll withdraw the lawsuit.''
Therein lies the story.
In 2004, Related was one of two developers vying for the site. Mr. Papert, who owned a minority interest in the land, helped steer the deal to Related. In the 1980s, Mr. Papert and his nonprofit group replaced several massage parlors on 42nd Street between Ninth and Dyer Avenues with Theater Row, a collection of small Off Broadway theaters. But they were unable to do the same thing on the next block.
Mr. Papert said he helped Related buy the land for about $107 million, because he understood that the developer would find a new home for the theaters in his proposed tower. Indeed, Related talked to city officials about an apartment building that would house two small theaters and a performance space for classical musicians.
Related, in turn, would have been able to take advantage of a city zoning regulation, a ''theater bonus,'' to build a taller tower than would have normally been allowed. But the company ultimately proposed to build an 1,800-seat theater for Cirque du Soleil, the human circus extravaganza. That plan was opposed by officials who argued that the bonus was intended to nurture struggling theater companies, not an economic blockbuster like Cirque.
The city's Planning Department ruled last February that the project did not qualify for a bonus. Related then put the parcel up for sale, asking about $350 million. But no one was willing to go that high.
Marisa Redanty, president of the tenants' association at Manhattan Plaza, which sits across 42nd Street from the site, said yesterday that Mr. Papert's lawsuit was premature. But, she added, the company is trying to clean up the area.
''If they do not continue to make the site more community-friendly, then all options are open,'' Ms. Redanty said. ''And if they give us the theaters, I'm happy as a clam.''

In a ceremony rich with gestures of openness and symbols of conquering adversity, Deval L. Patrick, the first black governor of Massachusetts, took his oath of office on Thursday. He promised far-reaching changes in attitude and policy and asked people to ''see our stake in each others' dreams and struggles as well as our own, and act on that.''
In the state's first outdoor inauguration, part of four days of events intended to include people across the state, Mr. Patrick, the first Democratic governor here in 16 years, said, ''For a very long time now we have been told that government is bad, that it exists only to serve the powerful and well-connected, that its job is not important enough to be done by anyone competent, let alone committed, and that all of us are on our own.''
Deval L. Patrick, the first Democratic governor of Massachusetts in 16 years and its first black governor, promised far-reaching changes in attitude and policy.

In the state's first outdoor inauguration, part of four days of events intended to include people across the state, Mr. Patrick, the first Democratic governor here in 16 years, said, ''For a very long time now we have been told that government is bad, that it exists only to serve the powerful and well-connected, that its job is not important enough to be done by anyone competent, let alone committed, and that all of us are on our own.''
''Today we join together in common cause,'' he said, ''to lay that fallacy to rest.''
Mr. Patrick takes over from Mitt Romney, a Republican, who is planning to run for the presidency, and already Mr. Patrick has revealed many positions that oppose Mr. Romney's. The former governor did not attend the inauguration.
Mr. Patrick has said that he will restore $383.6 million in budget cuts made by Mr. Romney to social services and other programs, that he will reverse the former governor's agreement authorizing the state police to arrest illegal immigrants, and that a Romney-endorsed effort to remove some Massachusetts Turnpike tolls is unrealistic.
Mr. Patrick also said he might revoke some of the 200 11th-hour appointments Mr. Romney made to boards and commissions.
And, while Mr. Romney strongly backed a proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, Mr. Patrick spoke out strongly against it this week, even as the legislature gave it first-round approval.
While the legislature is heavily Democratic in this heavily Roman Catholic state, many Democrats are more conservative than Mr. Patrick on issues like same-sex marriage. He also faces a budget deficit of about $1 billion. And it will not be easy to put into effect the state's new health insurance reform.
''I've never seen a governor who has such high expectations on him as Deval Patrick,'' said Jeffrey Berry, a political scientist at Tufts University. ''Democrats regard him as something of a demigod. They expect him to be able to leap tall buildings in a single bound and pay for social services.''
Paul Watanabe, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts-Boston, said: ''I think he's going to find that governing is a lot more challenging than being a candidate. And that the demands placed upon him by large numbers of individuals -- a record number of people that voted for him -- are going to be difficult to meet.''
Mr. Patrick also faces criticism over his inauguration celebrations. While much was inclusive -- the open-air ceremony, a town-meeting-like ''youth inaugural'' for students, and upcoming ceremonies in five other cities -- there was also a gala whose cost was paid for largely by corporate donors, who were allowed to give up to $50,000 each.
At the inauguration itself, however, on one of the balmiest January days in memory, the tone was full of possibility, pride and humility. In a state where the legacy of busing and segregation still stings, Mr. Patrick, reared in poverty on the South Side of Chicago, took the oath on a Bible given to John Quincy Adams by Africans from the Amistad slave ship whom Adams had helped free.
Four previous Massachusetts governors were present, as was L. Douglas Wilder, the former governor of Virginia and the only other black since Reconstruction to have been a governor.
The populist timbre, and the high expectations of Mr. Patrick, were sounded early, with a benediction by Rabbi Jonah Pesner describing the multicultural electorate and the problems of poverty, violence and discrimination.
''Behind every face hides so many secrets -- painful secrets of suffering,'' Rabbi Pesner said, urging the governor and the people to create ''a commonwealth rebuilt, repaired and redeemed.''
Among the crowd was Derward Jacobs, 60, who is disabled and who drove his scooter to the State House because ''I felt like I should be here.''
George Greenidge Jr., 35, leader of an alliance of black colleges, said, ''Today is a beacon of hope.''
Mr. Greenidge added that Mr. Patrick had ''re-engaged a constituency that really never was involved in state politics, especially people from lower economic backgrounds.''
Beth Gilbert, 52, of Norfolk, Mass., acknowledged the steep demands that confront Mr. Patrick, saying, ''When you elect a Republican governor, part of their bargain is they don't really believe that government can solve the people's problems. That's probably what's led to higher expectations here.''
Mr. Patrick signaled he was aware of the difficulties.
''I am an optimist, but not a foolish one,'' he said. ''I see clearly the challenges before us.''
He added: ''Change is not always comfortable or convenient or welcome. But it is what we hoped for, what we have worked for, what you voted for, and what you shall have.''

President Bush has decided to name Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus as the top American military commander in Iraq, part of a broad revamping of the military team that will carry out the administration's new Iraq strategy, administration officials said Thursday.
In addition to the promotion of General Petraeus, who will replace Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the choice to succeed Gen. John P. Abizaid as the head of the Central Command is expected to be Adm. William J. Fallon, who is the top American military officer in the Pacific, officials said.
The appointment of Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus is part of a revamping of the military team that will carry out a new Iraq strategy.
President Bush has decided to name Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus as the top American military commander in Iraq, part of a broad revamping of the military team that will carry out the administration's new Iraq strategy, administration officials said Thursday.
In addition to the promotion of General Petraeus, who will replace Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the choice to succeed Gen. John P. Abizaid as the head of the Central Command is expected to be Adm. William J. Fallon, who is the top American military officer in the Pacific, officials said.
The changes are being made as the White House is considering an option to increase American combat power in Baghdad by five brigades as well as adding two battalions of reinforcements to the volatile province of Anbar in western Iraq.
Mr. Bush, who said Thursday that he would present details of his overall strategy for Iraq next week, and several top aides held a video teleconference on Thursday, speaking with Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq and his top deputies about plans to add forces in the capital and other matters. The session lasted roughly an hour and 45 minutes.
''I said that 'You show the will, we will help you,' '' Mr. Bush told reporters.
Echoing the comments of both military and political advisers in recent weeks, he added, ''One thing is for certain: I will want to make sure that the mission is clear and specific and can be accomplished.''
Senior administration officials said that the choice of General Petraeus was part of a broader effort to change almost all of the top American officials in Iraq as Mr. Bush changes his strategy there.
''The idea is to put the whole new team in at roughly the same time, and send some clear messages that we are trying a new approach,'' a senior administration official said Thursday.
In addition to the military changes, Mr. Bush intends to appoint the ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, as the new United States ambassador to the United Nations, a senior administration official said Thursday.
''It was clearly time to move the players around on the field,'' said the senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because Mr. Bush had yet to announce the changes. ''This helps the president to make the case that this is a fresh start.''
Admiral Fallon would be the first Navy officer to serve as the senior officer of the Central Command, which is managing simultaneous ground wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Admiral Fallon is regarded within the military as one of its stronger regional combat commanders, and his possible appointment also reflects a greater emphasis on countering Iranian power, a mission that relies heavily on naval forces and combat airpower to project American influence in the Persian Gulf.
General Petraeus, who is now the head of the Army's Combined Arms Center at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., helped oversee the drafting of the military's comprehensive new manual on counterinsurgency. He has served two previous tours in Iraq, and some former officers say he sees the need for additional troops in Baghdad.
He will replace General Casey, whose plan for troop reductions in Iraq faltered last year in the face of escalating sectarian strife and who initially expressed public wariness about any short-term increase in troops in Iraq, a move that is now a leading option under consideration by the White House.
The departures of both General Casey and General Abizaid were expected, though in General Casey's case it appears to have been moved up several months from the originally anticipated shift in spring or summer. General Abizaid's tour had already been extended for a full year beyond the typical two-year stint, and he has announced that he will retire soon.
The troop increase option under discussion would focus on improving security in Baghdad. Under this approach, two Army combat brigades would be sent to the capital during the first phase of the operation. A combat brigade generally consists of about 3,500 soldiers. At the same time, a third brigade would be positioned in Kuwait as a reserve, and two more brigades would be on call in the United States.
The expectation is that these three brigades would eventually be sent to Baghdad as well, though the president would have the option to limit the reinforcements. Part of the increase could be achieved by holding some units past their currently scheduled return home.
Scaling up by five brigades would more than double the number of American combat troops involved in security operations in the Iraqi capital. The emphasis on Baghdad reflects the view that stability in the capital is a precondition for any broader effort to bring calm to the whole country. It is also a recognition that the administration sees sectarian violence as a greater threat to Iraq's stability than the Sunni Arab insurgency.
While Baghdad is the principal focus, the option also provides for sending two battalions of reinforcements to Anbar, where overstretched Marine and Army forces have been battling Sunni Arab insurgents. A basic battalion generally consists of 1,200 troops.
One issue under discussion is how to mesh the emerging American strategy with the Iraqis' capabilities. Bush administration officials say they want the increase in American troops to be paralleled by a considerable rise in the number of functional Iraqi troops. But the Iraqis failed in the summer to send all the reinforcements that had been requested, and some Iraqi security forces, particularly the police, have been infiltrated by militias.
Another point of contention is that some senior aides to Mr. Maliki have been notably unenthusiastic about an increase in American troops in Baghdad. During his meeting with Mr. Bush in Jordan in November, Mr. Maliki presented a plan that would shift most Americans to the periphery of Baghdad so they could concentrate on fighting Sunni insurgents while the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government asserted more control over the capital. That has left some American officials wondering whether the Maliki government was making a legitimate bid to exercise sovereignty or is committed to a sectarian Shiite agenda.
Bush administration officials believe that their new Iraqi strategy must involve political steps toward reconciliation and reconstruction programs to produce jobs.
In their teleconference, Mr. Bush and Mr. Maliki discussed the Iraqi government's efforts at political reconciliation and the Iraqi prime minister's vows to rein in militias, the pace of which American officials have found painfully slow. Discussing the execution of Saddam Hussein, Mr. Bush said the Maliki government was right to investigate the circumstances surrounding the hanging.
General Petraeus participated in the initial invasion of Iraq as the commander of the 101st Airborne Division. The division fought its way toward Baghdad and was later sent to Mosul in northern Iraq, where the general focused on political and economic reconstruction efforts.
''We are in a race to win over the people,'' read a sign in his Mosul headquarters. ''What have you and your element done today to contribute to victory?''
General Petraeus did a second tour in Iraq in which he oversaw the efforts to train the Iraqi Army. At his current post at Fort Leavenworth, he has been involved in the push to change the United States Army's training and education to emphasize counterinsurgency operations.
Jack Keane, the retired Army general who served as vice chief of the Army, called General Petraeus an ''imaginative commander who is experienced and knows how to deal with irregular warfare,'' as the Army refers to insurgencies.
The Iraq commander post is considered a four-star general's command, a promotion that would add a star to General Petraeus's shoulder.
Officials also said Admiral Fallon received a persuasive recommendation from the Joint Chiefs as one of the military's stronger commanders of a geographic theater, with his current command including the challenges of North Korea and China.
In that capacity, he also took the unusual and punitive move in December of canceling a large, annual field exercise with the Philippines over a local judge's failure to honor the bilateral treaty governing protections for American military personnel. The judge refused to honor the agreement's rule that American military personnel remain in American custody pending final appeal of all criminal proceedings against them, and ordered a marine convicted of rape held in a local jail even though the case was on appeal.

In a day of transition and pageantry, exultant Democrats on Thursday took control of both houses of Congress for the first time in a dozen years and elected the first woman to be speaker of the House.
Representative Nancy Pelosi of California took the speaker's gavel at 2:08 p.m. from Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, whom she defeated by a vote of 233 to 202, the 31-seat margin of the new Democratic majority. The floor and the packed galleries erupted in cheers when the vote was announced.
In a day of transition and pageantry, exultant Democrats on Thursday took control of both houses of Congress for the first time in a dozen years and elected the first woman to be speaker of the House.

Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, whom she defeated by a vote of 233 to 202, the 31-seat margin of the new Democratic majority. The floor and the packed galleries erupted in cheers when the vote was announced.
Even Republicans grudgingly acknowledged the unprecedented nature of the day on which a woman ascended to power on Capitol Hill by rising as one to applaud her.
''This is an historic moment,'' Mrs. Pelosi said in her first remarks as speaker of the 110th Congress. ''It's an historic moment for the Congress. It's an historic moment for the women of America. It is a moment for which we have waited for over 200 years.''
Earlier in the day, on the other side of the Capitol dome, Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, became majority leader, a result of his party's one-seat victory margin in the November elections.
Both Senator Reid and Speaker Pelosi promised a new era of cooperation after years of partisan passion and gridlock. ''Guided by the spirit of bipartisanship,'' Mr. Reid said, ''Democrats are ready to take this country in a new direction.''
The House opened the session by passing, by a large bipartisan margin, new ethics rules. [Page A13.]
But there were signs, too, of division among Democrats over how hard to push to undo the fruits of years of Republican rule. Many Democrats say those years moved the nation too far right, but others argue that the big tax cuts and regulatory relaxations are part of the permanent legislative framework that should be accepted. [News analysis, Page A12.]
In her remarks, Mrs. Pelosi delivered the obligatory promise of partnership with Republicans. But she immediately added a blunt warning to Mr. Bush on the war in Iraq.
''The American people rejected an open-ended obligation to a war without end,'' she said, bringing Democrats to their feet.
She signaled to Mr. Bush that any plan to increase the American military presence in Iraq would meet stiff opposition in the new Congress.
''It is the responsibility of the president to articulate a new plan for Iraq that makes it clear to the Iraqis that they must defend their own streets and their own security,'' she said, ''a plan that promotes stability in the region and a plan that allows us to responsibly redeploy our troops.''
Mrs. Pelosi's triumphal 20-minute remarks were frequently interrupted by applause, much like a presidential State of the Union address, which is delivered annually from the same rostrum in the House chamber. Cheering her on from the gallery were members of her family, dozens of California supporters and celebrities including Tony Bennett, Carole King and Richard Gere.
Mr. Boehner sat glum and unmoving in his seat for much of the hour it took to record the vote that put Mrs. Pelosi in the speaker's chair. The former speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, now just a Republican member of Congress from Illinois, stood hunched and hulking by the back rail of the chamber.
Mrs. Pelosi sat on the House floor with several of her grandchildren as her Democratic colleagues rose to record their votes, many adding footnotes. Representative Loretta Sanchez, Democrat of California, said she voted ''for the empowerment of all women in the world.'' Seventy-one women will be in the House, a record.
The jubilant Democratic takeover of the House was an echo of the Republican ''revolution'' of 1994 in which Republicans took control of the House after 40 uninterrupted years of Democratic dominance.
In the Senate, Vice President Dick Cheney, in his constitutional role as president of the chamber, swore in the members, including 10 new senators, only one a Republican, Bob Corker of Tennessee. A beaming Bill Clinton, accompanied by his daughter, Chelsea, and his mother-in-law, Dorothy Rodham, looked from the gallery as Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York took the oath at the outset of her second term, perhaps dreaming of another oath-taking that might be two years hence.
The first order of business for the new Democratic-led House was passage of a measure to limit gifts to lawmakers from lobbyists and to restrict subsidized flights on private aircraft. The bill is part of a larger package of ethics changes that Democrats are pushing as part of a promise to voters to end what they called a ''culture of corruption'' in Congress that led to several indictments and resignations of members last year.
Next week, the Democrats plan a 100-hour blitz to raise the minimum wage, lift restrictions on federal financing of embryonic stem cell research and allow the government to negotiate price cuts with pharmaceutical companies for the Medicare prescription drug program, among other matters. By the time they have clocked the 100 hours of legislative debate, House Democrats also plan to have passed bills to cut interest rates on student loans and roll back subsidies for oil and gas producers, seeking to make a statement of priorities, pressure the Senate to act and put an active agenda before the country before Mr. Bush's State of the Union address on Jan. 23.
In an early sign of bipartisanship, Senators Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, and Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, introduced a bill to repeal the individual alternative minimum tax, which is imposing an increasingly heavy burden on middle-income taxpayers.
But before much real business was conducted, Democratic lawmakers adjourned for a round of festivities to celebrate their victories and to lubricate their donors in what resembled nothing so much as a scaled-down presidential inaugural.
Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, who engineered the election of 42 new Democrats to the House as leader of the party's Congressional campaign committee, threw a huge reception at Johnny's Half Shell across the street from the Capitol. Mrs. Pelosi was the host of a gala at the National Building Museum at which Mr. Bennett and Ms. King were scheduled to perform.
Senator Claire McCaskill, the newly elected Democrat from Missouri and one of 16 women in the Senate, seemed a bit in awe after taking the oath of office on Thursday afternoon.
''Anybody who would go through that and not feel overwhelmed with the enormity of the institution and the men and women who have served there would have to be in a coma,'' Ms. McCaskill said in the lobby outside the Senate chamber. ''I'm sure there will be tough times ahead, but it's thrilling to be part of one of this country's enduring institutions.''

From the start, John D. Negroponte felt miscast as the nation's first director of national intelligence, a diplomat who never seemed comfortable in spook's clothing, colleagues and friends of his said.
Even at age 67, Mr. Negroponte longed to be back in the thick of policymaking, they said. But he knew it was the one role he was barred from playing as long as he remained the nation's top intelligence chief, whose role is to step into the Oval Office each morning as a neutral, impartial adviser on the threats lurking around the globe.
John D. Negroponte felt miscast as the nation’s first director of national intelligence, friends said.
From the start, John D. Negroponte felt miscast as the nation's first director of national intelligence, a diplomat who never seemed comfortable in spook's clothing, colleagues and friends of his said.
Even at age 67, Mr. Negroponte longed to be back in the thick of policymaking, they said. But he knew it was the one role he was barred from playing as long as he remained the nation's top intelligence chief, whose role is to step into the Oval Office each morning as a neutral, impartial adviser on the threats lurking around the globe.
It was because of this, officials said, that he agreed to do something generally unheard of in a city obsessed with the bureaucratic totem pole: trade a cabinet-level job for a subcabinet post as deputy secretary of state, a job that essentially requires him to handle tasks that Condoleezza Rice would rather not deal with.
Mr. Negroponte leaves his office at Bolling Air Force Base after only 19 months and with mixed reviews. The base is the home of a new intelligence bureaucracy created to solve the problems laid bare after the Sept. 11 attacks, but Mr. Negroponte barely had time to get it running. All over Washington on Thursday, there were questions about whether Mr. Negroponte was there long enough to lay the foundations of real change and whether his transfer suggested that the Bush administration was less committed than it claimed to be to an intelligence overhaul that President Bush had billed as the most significant restructuring of American spy agencies in half a century.
Senior administration officials said it was Mr. Bush who personally asked Mr. Negroponte to take on the diplomatic post sometime last month. It was the second time in two years that Mr. Bush had turned to Mr. Negroponte to fill a critical job: Mr. Negroponte became the director of national intelligence only after several other candidates had turned down the job. This time around, Ms. Rice had requested over the summer that Mr. Negroponte become her deputy. But the decision languished for months as the White House sought an adequate replacement for the spy chief, and as Mr. Negroponte vacillated between remaining at the helm of an intelligence community that numbered roughly 100,000 people and a return to the State Department, in the shadow of the administration's most visible international figure.
Senior administration officials said that Ms. Rice wanted Mr. Negroponte to focus on China and North Korea, which have been among his focuses in the intelligence post, and on Iraq, a country he knows particularly well.
Mr. Negroponte has also served as ambassador to the United Nations, Mexico, the Philippines and Honduras, in a Foreign Service career that spanned more than three decades. A senior administration official who was involved in discussions about his nomination said that Ms. Rice regarded him as a foreign policy moderate who could help fill the big voids left by the departure of Robert B. Zoellick, who stepped down as deputy secretary last summer, and Philip D. Zelikow, who left the job of State Department counselor last month.
Ms. Rice would continue to play a central role in Iraq policy, the official said, but she has also made it clear that she wants to devote more time to a broader diplomatic initiative aimed at Middle East peace.
Mr. Bush is expected to nominate Mike McConnell, a retired vice admiral and former chief of the National Security Agency, to be Mr. Negroponte's successor.
John E. McLaughlin, a former director of central intelligence who is a friend of Mr. Negroponte, said that he managed to make the transition from career Foreign Service officer to the intelligence arena with little difficulty, but that Mr. Negroponte was now returning to the world where he felt most at ease.
Mr. McLaughlin said he believed that Mr. Negroponte's familiarity with the latest intelligence from Iraq would help to bring a ''realistic'' view of the situation there as the administration works to develop a new strategy.
But other intelligence experts expressed concern about what Mr. Negroponte's departure might mean to the office he helped to establish. ''My major concern about this appointment is not about the State Department, but what happens at the D.N.I. office,'' said Lee H. Hamilton, who served as co-chairman of both the 9/11 commission and the Iraq Study Group. ''The future of that office and the concept of intelligence-sharing is on the line.''
Top Congressional officials responded angrily to the news of Mr. Negroponte's departure.
''I think he walked off the job, and I don't like it,'' said Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, the new chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Just as Mr. Negroponte is leaving his post, his office is finishing a major National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq's chances of surviving as a unified, independent country -- a review that was commissioned only after a Congressional request over the summer, on a problem that Mr. Negroponte will have to help manage in his new post.
''He came into it after just a year in Iraq, and someone without a strong background in intelligence, and I think he is leaving awfully early, given the importance of getting this right,'' said Robert Hutchings, the senior diplomat in residence at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton, who once headed the National Intelligence Council.
''I think it is quite irresponsible,'' he said.
Mr. Hutchings said the departure would compound ''three or four years of nonstop turmoil'' within American intelligence agencies.
Bush administration officials noted several successes during Mr. Negroponte's tenure, most significant the creation and progress of the National Counterterrorism Center. Terrorism experts have credited the center with fusing information from across the intelligence community to understand better the global terrorism threat.
But as he assembled a staff of more than 1,500 people, he was criticized for simply adding another layer to a bureaucracy he was assigned to streamline. But some intelligence experts said that the criticism was unfair, and that the real blame rested with Congress for passing convoluted legislation that made bureaucratic bloat at the director of national intelligence office inevitable. Some critics say that the job of spy czar was never necessary to begin with. Some of those whom the White House first approached to take the job nearly two years ago -- including Robert M. Gates, the newly installed secretary of defense -- were deeply skeptical about whether that structure would work.
The White House spokesman, Tony Snow, said that President Bush was ''very impressed'' with the job Mr. Negroponte had done.
One of the greatest difficulties of Mr. Negroponte's position has been trying to wrest control over multibillion dollar spy satellites and other gadgetry from the Pentagon, which historically had been in charge of 80 percent of the nation's intelligence budget.
One of the top priorities of the former defense secretary, Donald H. Rumsfeld, was to expand the Pentagon's role in intelligence gathering, and some members of Congress say that Mr. Negroponte was not aggressive enough in bringing the Pentagon's intelligence budget more under his control.
Some intelligence experts believe that Mr. Gates is likely to be less territorial than Mr. Rumsfeld was about the Pentagon's intelligence functions, and may even be eager to cede some of the Pentagon's authority to the new intelligence chief. Others said that the job of corralling 16 sometimes dysfunctional intelligence agencies is an often thankless task, and one where it is difficult to have a noticeable impact. Mr. Negroponte is said by associates to have grown particularly weary of clashes with members of Congress.
''I think it's pretty telling that both Bob Gates and John Negroponte prefer jobs trying to bail us out of Iraq to the job of trying to fix U.S. intelligence,'' said Amy Zegart, a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles and an expert in intelligence overhaul.

Ali al-Marri, whom the government calls a sleeper agent for Al Qaeda and who is the only person on the American mainland still held as an enemy combatant, spends his days in a small cell in solitary confinement at the Navy brig in Charleston, S.C. When he is in an ironic mood, his lawyers say, he calls the cell his villa.
Mr. Marri waits there for word from his wife, two sons and three daughters, whom he last saw in 2001, just before his arrest in Peoria, Ill., where he was studying computer science at Bradley University.
The only person on the American mainland still held as an enemy combatant wants to challenge his detention.
Ali al-Marri, whom the government calls a sleeper agent for Al Qaeda and who is the only person on the American mainland still held as an enemy combatant, spends his days in a small cell in solitary confinement at the Navy brig in Charleston, S.C. When he is in an ironic mood, his lawyers say, he calls the cell his villa.
Mr. Marri waits there for word from his wife, two sons and three daughters, whom he last saw in 2001, just before his arrest in Peoria, Ill., where he was studying computer science at Bradley University.
Letters arrive, but they are late and have words and sentences blacked out. A note his wife sent to him 10 months ago landed recently. It began with a standard Muslim invocation, but a word was missing. Mr. Marri is pretty sure it was ''Allah.''
But mostly Mr. Marri waits for word from a federal appeals court, which will soon rule on one of the most urgent questions in American law, one his case presents in stark form: May the government indefinitely detain a foreigner living legally in the United States, without charges and without access to the courts?
Mr. Marri, who is 41 and a citizen of Qatar, wants the right to challenge President Bush's assertion that he is a terrorist and ''a grave danger to the national security of the United States.''
The Bush administration says the courts cannot second-guess the president when he decides that someone is an enemy combatant, at least when noncitizens are involved. Detaining combatants is a military rather than a criminal matter, the administration says, adding that its purpose is not to punish the prisoner but to stop him from returning to the battlefield.
The implications of that position are startling, according to a brief filed last month in Mr. Marri's case by some 30 constitutional scholars. ''The government's interpretation would be vastly threatening to the liberty of more than 20 million noncitizens residing in the United States,'' the brief said, ''exposing them to the risk of irremediable indefinite detention on the basis of unfounded rumors, mistaken identity, the desperation of other detainees subject to coercive interrogation, and the deliberate lies of actual terrorists.''
Kathleen M. Blomquist, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, disputed that contention.
''Of all the terrorists currently in the custody of the United States military, al-Marri is the only one who was captured in the United States,'' Ms. Blomquist said, adding that the notion that millions of people are at risk is ''unfounded and absurd.''
Mr. Bush's determination that Mr. Marri is an enemy combatant, she said, was based on substantial evidence, including ''his association with Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, and files found on his computer concerning chemical weapons of mass destruction.''
Mr. Marri maintains his innocence, his lawyers say. But they have refused to offer point-by-point rebuttals of the government's detailed assertions, calling instead for prosecutors to offer evidence to back them up in court.
''In a civilized society and under American law and tradition,'' said Jonathan Hafetz, a lawyer for Mr. Marri with the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, ''the government has the obligation to prove its case.''
One of Mr. Marri's brothers, Mohammed Marri, in a telephone interview from Qatar, rejected the charge that Mr. Marri is a terrorist. ''For sure it's not true,'' he said.
A third brother, Jarallah, is at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, held as an enemy combatant based on accusations that he had visited a Qaeda camp. ''This is not a proper way to treat other people from other countries,'' Mohammed Marri said of his brothers and other detainees. ''If they are guilty, let them prove it in court.''
An Exclusive Club
The Charleston brig can hold 288 military prisoners and 6 enemy combatants, but there have never been more than 3 in the exclusive enemy combatant club. Two of them are now gone.
One of them, Yaser Hamdi, was freed and sent to Saudi Arabia after the United States Supreme Court allowed him to challenge his detention in 2004. Jose Padilla was transferred to the criminal justice system last year just as the Supreme Court was considering whether to review his case. That leaves only Mr. Marri.
Mr. Hamdi and Mr. Padilla are American citizens, but Mr. Marri is not. They were seized abroad or on their way back to the United States, while Mr. Marri was living what seemed to be an ordinary life, in Peoria, a city often caricatured as the nation's most ordinary, with a family and a minivan.
The government contends in a partly declassified declaration from a senior defense intelligence official, Jeffrey N. Rapp, and in a recent book by former Attorney General John Ashcroft, that Mr. Marri was a Qaeda sleeper agent sent to the United States to commit mass murder and disrupt the banking system.
The assertions have not been tested in court, and human rights groups say they are based on unreliable evidence ''There is substantial reason to believe,'' lawyers for two of the groups wrote in a brief in November, ''that the allegations of the Rapp declaration are derived from the torture of two men interrogated at Guantánamo Bay and other detention sites: Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi.''
The government says that Mr. Hawsawi was one of the financiers of the Sept. 11 attacks.
Mr. Rapp's declaration cites the personal views of Mr. Mohammed, who is often referred to as K.S.M. ''K.S.M. considered al-Marri an ideal sleeper agent,'' Mr. Rapp wrote.
Kept in Isolation
Mr. Marri was kept in isolation at the brig and, according to his court filings, subjected to tough interrogation. Interrogators threatened to send him to Egypt or Saudi Arabia, according to a lawsuit filed on his behalf in 2005, ''where, they told him, he would be tortured and sodomized and where his wife would be raped in front on him.''
''By winter '05,'' Andrew J. Savage, who also represents Mr. Marri, said in a recent interview, ''I genuinely thought he was losing his mind. He told me in this sort of indirect way that he might not be able to hold on, that his mind was playing tricks on him.''
Mr. Padilla's lawyers have said that their client's time in the brig was so grueling that he is not fit to stand trial. But while Mr. Padilla was passive, Mr. Marri pushed back. He put wet toilet paper on the video camera, for instance. The brig responded by taking away his mattress, Koran and hygienic products, including his toilet paper.
''There is almost nothing to distract him from his torment,'' his lawyers wrote in the lawsuit, ''and he therefore becomes preoccupied with his pain and the degradation he suffers.''
Perhaps as a consequence of the lawsuit, conditions have improved.
When Mr. Marri's lawyers were first allowed to see him in October 2004, after the decision in Mr. Hamdi's case, Mr. Marri was behind a transparent barrier and bound in leg-irons and handcuffs that were linked to a belly-chain and fastened to the floor. Officials from the Defense Intelligence Agency and the brig were present, and the conversation was videotaped.
On a recent visit, Mr. Savage said, he met his client in a visiting lounge. Mr. Marri, who was not restrained, was wearing stylish bifocals rather than institutional prison glasses. He was also wearing a watch, which makes it easier for him to know when to pray.
Mr. Savage brought hummus and pita bread. ''We sat down, we broke bread, and we had a three-and-a-half hour conversation, unmonitored,'' Mr. Savage said.
Mr. Marri is now allowed to watch television in the evening, but not the news. He reads newspapers and magazines, but they are edited. ''Brig staff remove all materials associated with the war on terror from them,'' Cmdr. Stephanie L. Wright, the brig's commanding officer, said in court filing in July.
Sometimes that makes for a thin newspaper. ''All I get is sports and obits,'' Mr. Marri has complained, Mr. Savage said. He is critical of the former, saying there is not enough soccer coverage.
The Defense Department has allowed journalists and others to tour the Guantánamo facility, where Mr. Marri's brother Jarallah and 400 other men are being held. All of the Guantánamo prisoners are foreigners who were seized abroad. The government has not asserted that the brothers were working together.
The Defense Department refused a recent request to inspect the Charleston brig. A spokesman, Cmdr. J. D. Gordon, cited ''operational security concerns surrounding the detention of an alleged al Qaeda-linked operative in the U.S. mainland,'' a reference to Mr. Marri. Commander Gordon added that ''it has always been our policy to treat all detainees humanely.''
Return to the United States
Mr. Marri spent eight years in the United States as a young man, graduating from Bradley with an undergraduate degree in business administration in 1991. When he returned to the United States 10 years later, he brought his family.
In his declaration, Mr. Rapp noted that Mr. Marri's profile ''differed significantly from that of the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers.'' Those differences, Mr. Rapp said, made Mr. Marri all the more attractive to Al Qaeda.
The years between Mr. Marri's two stints at Bradley are a mystery. The government says he trained at a Qaeda camp in Afghanistan for about a year and a half between 1996 and 1998, specializing in poisons. The government also says that Mr. Marri visited the United States briefly in 2000, which Mr. Marri has denied.
In the summer of 2001, Mr. Rapp wrote, Mr. Mohammed introduced Mr. Marri to Osama bin Laden. Mr. Marri ''offered to be an Al Qaeda martyr,'' Mr. Rapp wrote.
''Al Qaeda instructed al-Marri that it was imperative that he arrive in the United States prior to Sept. 11, 2001, and that if al-Marri could not do so, that he should cancel all his plans and go to Pakistan,'' Mr. Rapp wrote.
The Marris arrived in Peoria on Sept. 10, 2001.
Mr. Marri soon came to the attention of the F.B.I., which first interviewed him less than a month later. In December, agents searched his laptop, finding ''research consistent with the tradecraft and teachings associated with Al Qaeda,'' Mr. Rapp wrote. Mr. Marri was arrested on Dec. 12, 2001, and held as a material witness at the request of prosecutors in New York. He was indicted two months later on charges of credit card fraud. In January 2003, the government added charges of lying to federal agents and financial institutions, and identity theft. Mr. Marri pleaded not guilty. His family has since returned to the Middle East.
For a year and a half, the government pursued a conventional criminal case. Mr. Ashcroft, in his book ''Never Again,'' which was published in October, wrote that Mr. Marri ''rejected numerous offers to improve his lot'' by cooperating with investigators. ''He insisted,'' Mr. Ashcroft wrote, ''on becoming a 'hard case.' ''
In June 2003, as the case was nearing trial, the government abruptly changed course, taking Mr. Marri out of the criminal system and moving him into indefinite military detention. That means, Mr. Ashcroft later wrote, that Mr. Marri can be held ''at least until the war against Al Qaeda was over.''
In its rush to move Mr. Marri, the government short-circuited its criminal case. On hearing that a federal judge in Peoria would allow Mr. Marri's lawyers to file papers opposing the transfer as long as the criminal case was alive, the government agreed to dismiss the criminal charges with prejudice, meaning they cannot be refiled.
The decision, however, would not prevent the government from charging Mr. Marri with other crimes outlined in Mr. Rapp's declaration.
The declaration has served the purpose for which it was designed. In August, it persuaded Henry F. Floyd, a federal judge in Spartanburg, S.C., to deny a habeas corpus petition challenging Mr. Marri's detention. Saying that Mr. Marri had ''offered nothing more than a general denial'' of the assertions in the declaration, Judge Floyd dismissed the petition.
Neither side was happy with the ruling. Mr. Marri has appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, saying that the president does not have the power to detain him as an enemy combatant.
A foreigner living legally in the United States, his lawyers say, is not the same as a soldier captured on a battlefield. Even if the president does have the power, they say, he should be required to support his assertions with evidence.
The government argues that Judge Floyd gave Mr. Marri too full a hearing. It cited the recent Military Commissions Act, which says that the courts have no jurisdiction to hear challenges from any alien ''who has been determined by the United States to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant.''
The case will be heard Feb. 1
The government offered Mr. Marri a sort of consolation prize should the appeals court dismiss his case. It said he could try to persuade a combatant status review tribunal, convened by the Defense Department, that he was not an enemy combatant. That would apparently be the first such proceeding on the mainland; all of the others known to have been conducted were at Guantánamo Bay.
A Different View
In a brief filed in November, eight former Justice Department officials, including Janet Reno, the attorney general in the Clinton administration, said that taking Mr. Marri out of the criminal system as his case approached trial ''has given to the appearance of manipulation of the judicial process.'' The brief listed several criminal statutes available to prosecute people accused of terrorism along with many successful prosecutions under them.
''The criminal justice system has proven that it can make the cases,'' Ms. Reno said in an interview. ''For the president to be able to designate someone as an enemy combatant, without process and without regulation, just doesn't make any sense and isn't necessary.''
Ms. Blomquist, the Justice Department spokeswoman, said, ''While we respect the views of former law enforcement officials, the United States cannot afford to retreat to a pre-September 11 mind-set that treats terrorism solely as a domestic law enforcement problem.''
Mr. Marri shared a fantasy with one of his lawyers not long ago. ''I'd love to be taken back to Saudi Arabia and they would beat the'' -- here, he swore -- ''out of me for six months,'' Mr. Marri said, according to Mr. Savage. ''It would be brutal, but it would be finite.''

There are a slew of products out there from different manufacturers including thermostats and security systems that have wireless capability and can be controlled remotely over the Internet.
When my son comes down here and turns the thermostat down to 68 degrees, I can turn it back up from my home in Illinois. I can log on to a Web page from anywhere and control all the lights, the drapes, the outdoor lights, the garage door and even the temperature of the hot tub. One day, I logged on and saw that the hot tub was 103 degrees. My son had been using the house and forgot to turn it off. I don't ever rent out my house, but family members use it when I'm not there. They don't always remember to turn off the lights or adjust the thermostat when they leave. They don't get the electric bill.
Hard-wiring an existing house with these capabilities would be an electrician's dream. It would cost tens of thousands of dollars. But with these new wireless systems it ran about $4,000 to set up. But more importantly, it gives me peace of mind. The house still has old hurricane shutters that have to be put up the old-fashioned way, but early this year new models that attach to the house and can be operated over a computer should be out.

The ''Beast of Broadway,'' as the tabloids call him, a successful actor, has been accused of sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl. But his grade-school teacher would be proud of him in at least one respect: He is a good speller.
That much was clear in the two and-a-half page written statement he gave the police after he was arrested, a statement that recounted a behind-the-scenes theater tour for the girl. He wrote these words voluntarily despite a constitutional right to remain silent that is ingrained not only in criminal law, but also in popular culture. But he was hardly the only person arrested in New York in recent years who opened up once the cuffs went on.
Notwithstanding the constitutional right to remain silent, some people talk freely after they are arrested.
The ''Beast of Broadway,'' as the tabloids call him, a successful actor, has been accused of sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl. But his grade-school teacher would be proud of him in at least one respect: He is a good speller.
That much was clear in the two and-a-half page written statement he gave the police after he was arrested, a statement that recounted a behind-the-scenes theater tour for the girl. He wrote these words voluntarily despite a constitutional right to remain silent that is ingrained not only in criminal law, but also in popular culture. But he was hardly the only person arrested in New York in recent years who opened up once the cuffs went on.
A former Women's Wear Daily writer, accused of disguising himself in a firefighter's costume and sexually assaulting a former colleague on Halloween, kept detectives spellbound with his disquisitions on Chinese menus and book rights.
A homeless man accused of stabbing a tourist as he rode with his girlfriend on the subway found that words weren't enough. Asked to sign his confession, he instead sketched a cartoon version of his crime: a pair of lovers' faces -- one happy and one sad -- and a stormy black cloud floating over a subway train.
Such statements -- and occasional illustrations -- by defendants in New York City courts are one element of what prosecutors call the V.D.F., more formally known as the People's Voluntary Disclosure Form. To read them is to experience a kind of poetry of everyday criminal life in New York City.
By turns raw, ugly, poignant, defiant, rarely remorseful and almost always damaging, the statements are a window into the criminal process, part of the common language between detectives and suspects.
''It's kind of like the literature of the criminal defendant,'' said Gerald L. Shargel, a criminal defense lawyer. ''The information contained on the V.D.F. is much more rich and colorful than anything the defense lawyer provides.''
Because they can be so revealing, the V.D.F.'s are a bane of defense lawyers' existence, and they often try to suppress them so they cannot be used in court.
More technically, the Voluntary Disclosure Form is a rough, preliminary summary of the evidence, which the prosecution is required to give to the defense. There is space for prosecutors to type out information like the date, place and time of the ''occurrence.''
And there is space for detectives to provide statements made by defendants at the time of arrest, either as summarized by the police, or in the defendant's own writing.
For many people, the urge to explain, if not to confess, is as urgent as it was for Raskolnikov in ''Crime and Punishment.''
''My name is Paul Cortez,'' is the Melvillian first sentence of the V.D.F. statement handwritten by Mr. Cortez, a yoga teacher who is awaiting trial as the suspect in the fatal stabbing of a dancer in her Upper East Side apartment.
What follows is a three-page roller coaster ride of love, sex and betrayal, culminating in an alibi. On the day of the victim's death, Mr. Cortez wrote, ''I knew something was wrong, so I called back several times.'' When she didn't answer, he called clients, watched a football game with a friend, ''then read a little and went to bed. The next morning about 10:30 I found out from my mom Catherine was Dead.''
The last word, ''Dead,'' is capitalized for emphasis.
Prosecutors love to have defendants volunteer an alibi because it shows what they call ''consciousness of guilt.''
Stacey Richman, a criminal defense lawyer, summed up her advice to any accused who may feel the urge to chat: ''You have a right to remain silent. Exercise that right.''
When Peter Braunstein, the former Women's Wear Daily writer, was arrested in Memphis in December 2005, he seemed, in one of many Hamlet-like moments, torn about talking. ''I really don't think I should talk to you,'' Mr. Braunstein began, according to his V.D.F. ''I think I should do the whole lawyer thing.''
And then he kept talking.
''Everybody talks,'' said Daniel J. Castleman, chief of investigations for the Manhattan district attorney. ''Almost nobody doesn't talk. And the reason for that is that people think they can either talk their way out of it or mitigate the crime. It's human nature.''
Mr. Braunstein, who is in a mental hospital awaiting trial on charges of kidnapping and sexual abuse, seemed to delight in his celebrity. ''Defendant referred to book and movie deals using the name of the complainant several times,'' the V.D.F. says.
He fantasized about ordering Chinese food. ''Defendant stated that after seeing news reports, if he went to a Chinese restaurant, he should order something other than beef with extra mustard because that is what the wanted poster says he orders, but if he did that, it would be too obvious, so he would order beef with extra mustard, but he had not eaten Chinese food for a while.''
Mr. Braunstein did not sign anything, unlike James Barbour, the actor called the ''Beast of Broadway,'' who once played the Beast in ''Beauty and the Beast.'' Mr. Barbour wrote his statement in block letters, correctly spelled, indented and punctuated it, and signed it with a flourish.
Accused of having a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl, he wrote, ''She told me that she was 16.''
Unfortunately for Mr. Barbour, the age of consent in New York is 17.
''That evening we went to a Broadway show, 'George Gershwin Alone,' '' wrote Mr. Barbour, who is free on $10,000 bail. ''I introduced her to the star of the show, gave her a backstage tour. The relationship stopped suddenly because I thought it was inappropriate and could get dangerous.''
Defendants may try to talk their way out of a charge, but do they succeed?
''Never,'' said Gerald B. Lefcourt, who has defended clients from the Black Panthers to Harry B. Helmsley. ''Which is why if it's up to me, every client I have should know they should never, ever, under any circumstances speak to law enforcement unless I'm there.''
What Joseph Weir, accused of groping feet on the subway, lacked in spelling skills, he made up for with an almost Gallic appreciation for women. ''I complyment woman, I bow down to them, sometime I kiss there feet and grab legs.'' Mr. Weir, charged with sex abuse, coercion and other less than gallant acts, is due back in court on Jan. 19.
Alexis Quinlin, a swindler posing as a French photographer, actually wrote his statement in French, perhaps casting doubt on those who would contend that the police put words in the mouths of criminals.
''Je m'appelle Alexis Quinlin,'' wrote Mr. Quinlin, who was convicted of grand larceny and sentenced to up to seven and a half years in prison, but was not lying about being French. He described how he signed a contract under the assumed name of Jean Baptiste Mondino, which was, he admitted, ''une grave erreur.''
Robert De Niro's housekeeper, Lucyna Turyk-Wawrynowicz, accused of stealing clothes and jewelry from her wealthy employers, made the mistake of giving the police shopping tips. ''Anybody can buy a jacket like this at Century 21,'' Ms. Turyk-Wawrynowicz said after she was taken into custody in June 2005, according to a transcript typed by the police.
An hour later, she was insulting Mr. De Niro's wife, Grace Hightower, saying, ''She is mean.''
After about three hours, she announced, ''The diamonds are in the bathroom.''
After requesting a Starbucks skim latte from the detectives questioning her, she threw in the towel.
''I am evil and guilty, but my husband did nothing,'' she said. ''You can cut my hands and head off, but I can tell you he did nothing wrong.'' She pleaded guilty to grand larceny and last February was sentenced to up to three years in prison.
Others get right to the point.
''I hate Sammy,'' Kristina Caban said of the man she was accused of branding with an ''R,'' as if he were a bull, according to the police transcript. ''He raped me two years ago.'' Ms. Caban, charged with assault with intent to disfigure permanently, is due back in court on Jan. 11.
Civil libertarians have called for police interrogations to be videotaped. ''We've had reports from clients who say they wrote something, but the police officers were dictating it,'' said Seymour W. James Jr., the lawyer in charge of the criminal practice at the Legal Aid Society. ''They're intimidated by the police after hours of questioning.''
Sometimes, it takes very little prompting for a defendant to put her foot in her mouth. In her V.D.F., Andrea Schwartz, whom the tabloids have termed ''the Brazilian madam,'' is quoted telling the police as she was arrested: ''I'm not a prostitute. I just hook guys up with girls if they want them.''
That did not stop prosecutors from indicting her on prostitution charges last June. She is awaiting trial.
Editors' Note:  January 25, 2007, Thursday  A front-page article on Jan. 5 about the tendency of criminal suspects in New York City to give revealing and usually damaging statements to the police, despite their right to remain silent, included excerpts from the statement of James Barbour, a Broadway actor accused of sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl. According to his statement, Mr. Barbour told the police that he had lain on a bed with the girl and that they had kissed.
But the article should have made it clear that in the statement, Mr. Barbour does not admit or confess to having sexually assaulted the girl, and that he has pleaded not guilty.

Carolyn Whigham stood on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and took in the landscape of tattered brownstones, trash-strewn lots and skinny addicts by the front door of the funeral home that has been in her family for three generations. Then she closed her eyes and a vision of the street in the 1950s took hold, a reverie of mansions, graceful oak trees and the reassuring roar of a bustling industrial city.
''I can see Lawyer Tate, Dr. Shelton, Old Lady Ruffin and all the beautiful buildings,'' Mrs. Whigham said, ticking off the people who once filled the granite-and-marble Victorians. ''It was a gem. For a black family, it was a dream to be living here.''
After years of decline and sporadic renewal efforts, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard shows signs of progress.
Carolyn Whigham stood on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and took in the landscape of tattered brownstones, trash-strewn lots and skinny addicts by the front door of the funeral home that has been in her family for three generations. Then she closed her eyes and a vision of the street in the 1950s took hold, a reverie of mansions, graceful oak trees and the reassuring roar of a bustling industrial city.
''I can see Lawyer Tate, Dr. Shelton, Old Lady Ruffin and all the beautiful buildings,'' Mrs. Whigham said, ticking off the people who once filled the granite-and-marble Victorians. ''It was a gem. For a black family, it was a dream to be living here.''
In the summer of 1967, the Whighams huddled on their rooftop as rioters burned neighboring buildings; then the Whighams helped bury a dozen victims of the violence. In the decades since, they have witnessed the flight of the professional class and the onslaught of drugs and despair, planning countless funerals for teenagers killed by gunfire and young mothers felled by AIDS.
''To see all that happening to my street, to my city, has been very traumatic,'' Mrs. Whigham, 57, said.
But now, across the street from where she grew up, workers are laying sod in front of 100 crisp Georgian-style town houses that replaced a forbidding housing project. A few blocks north, a new dormitory for 800 students is to be finished by fall. To the east, the steel bones of a hockey arena are filling the horizon. Throughout Newark, even on the most ragged blocks, new three-family homes are selling for $400,000.
''This city is coming back,'' Mrs. Whigham said. ''It's finally happening, and I believe it's going to happen in my lifetime.''
After 30 years of decline and a decade of sporadic renewal efforts, the two-mile boulevard through Newark's Central Ward -- known as High Street until 1983 -- is showing signs of progress. So is the entire city.
More than 2,500 private homes are being built, Barnes & Noble is looking downtown, and hundreds of suburbanites and New Yorkers are moving into the city's first luxury high-rise in a generation.
Though these projects began under his predecessor, Sharpe James, Cory A. Booker, Newark's ambitious young mayor, has revved up the momentum since he took office in July. He has made lofty promises to recast his struggling city as a national model for urban revitalization, and dismantled bureaucratic impediments to development. His administration plans to lift the more stringent zoning rules to encourage downtown residential construction, create building trade apprenticeships for jobless young people and develop a municipal loan pool for minority business owners.
''It feels like all the pieces are finally coming together,'' said Dennis M. Bone, president of Verizon New Jersey, one of the few corporations to keep its headquarters here as Newark lost many of its blue-chip employers and almost half its population.
Yet Newark faces steep obstacles to prosperity. Real estate taxes are onerous, the public school system is in shambles and any new businesses Mr. Booker may bring in will find a largely unskilled work force: of those 25 and older, 58 percent lack a high school diploma and 9 percent have a bachelor's degree, according to the 2000 census.
As it stands, more than three-quarters of the city's 150,000 jobs are held by out-of-towners. For Mr. Booker, already tarnished in the eyes of some as an outsider for his suburban upbringing and criticized for hiring too many aides from New York, the true challenge will be to spread change beyond a few shiny spots in the business district downtown into the struggling neighborhoods.
''All my life, the politicians have been calling this place the Renaissance City,'' complained Latonya Edwards, 28, a part-time security guard who is raising three children in a decrepit apartment building on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. ''I think the renaissance is for suburban people who go downtown. If they have their way, people like me would just disappear.''
Even some of Newark's biggest civic boosters worry about outsize expectations after Mr. Booker's public pronouncements of the city's potential. (The mayor, a vegetarian, often talks about luring a Whole Foods market to the city.) And while Newark's overall crime rate dropped last year, homicides recently reached a 10-year high, hardly helping to improve its reputation.
''The edge is so thin right now,'' said Alfred C. Koeppe, president of the Newark Alliance, a consortium of business leaders working to improve the economy and schools. ''All it takes is one kid who recently moved here to get shot on the way to the PATH train and it could be all over.''
Still, urban experts say Newark, population 278,000, has an edge over other midsize cities still stumbling from the loss of their manufacturing bedrock. Just 10 miles from Manhattan and surrounded by wealthy suburbs, Newark is blessed with an expanding seaport, an international airport and a skein of highways and commuter rail lines.
Quietly and with little fanfare, high-tech entrepreneurs have set up shop over the past decade at a 60-acre science park that is growing alongside the city's five colleges and professional schools. In October, the hockey arena is scheduled to join a decade-old performing arts center that has proved successful in drawing visitors to a downtown that otherwise feels like a disused Hollywood set after dusk.
''The one thing that New Jersey lacks is a premier city,'' said Thomas K. Wright, executive vice president of the Regional Plan Association, which has helped formulate redevelopment plans for a number of struggling cities in New York's orbit. ''This is Newark's moment to become that city. It's going to happen in the next few years. Or it won't.''
Directing Mr. Booker's economic development efforts is Stefan Pryor, a friend from Yale Law School who led efforts to revive Lower Manhattan after 9/11. Now, as one of Newark's three deputy mayors, Mr. Pryor has been hawking Newark to national retailers, streamlining the way City Hall doles out licenses and building permits, and trying to create a new Planning Department to replace a politicized, fragmented one that developers say often stymied projects.
''In the past you had to do back flips and jump through rings of fire,'' Mr. Pryor said at a recent Chamber of Commerce breakfast where he gave a presentation of the streamlined permit process. ''This is a new era. We're going to be the new high-integrity folks at City Hall who you can talk to with intelligence.''
Mr. Pryor, 34, recently moved from Manhattan to an Art Deco tower a few blocks off Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard that has become a highly visible symbol -- and test -- of Newark's aspirations. Vacant for 20 years, the building at Raymond Boulevard and Broad Street is being transformed into 317 apartments, and will feature valet parking, a mod bowling alley and a yoga studio. The average rent for a two-bedroom is $2,500; the building is still under renovation, but half the finished apartments have been rented.
A year from now, the landlord, Cogswell Realty Group, plans to break ground nearby on a project that would bring 2,900 units to a stretch of Broad Street now dominated by abandoned department stores. The company sees its markets as college students who currently commute to Newark, young professionals priced out of Manhattan and empty-nesters seeking an urban experience without depleting their savings.
''When we started this 18 months ago, there were plenty of people who thought we wouldn't sign a single lease or that we wouldn't get the rents we're getting,'' Arthur Stern, Cogswell's chief executive, said during a tour of the health club in the Art Deco building. ''I think we've proven everyone wrong.''
Mr. Pryor was among the first to move in, as much to make a statement about the area's viability as for the five-minute walk to work. Unpacking boxes in his 15th-floor apartment one recent evening, he gazed out at City Hall's gold-leaf dome and the fast-rising arena. Then his eye settled on the darkened 19th-century mercantile buildings in the foreground. ''I'm hoping we can inject these buildings with some life,'' he said.
To that end, Mr. Pryor soon plans to ask the City Council to eliminate stringent zoning rules that have made it difficult to get approval to renovate the upper floors of commercial buildings. Another major goal is revamping the city's master plan, which has not been updated in 50 years. In a city with no bookstores and just two supermarkets, he spends most of his days on the phone with retailers and restaurateurs, talking up the untapped spending power of Newark residents.
Business leaders and politicians alike say such retail -- and residential -- development depends in part on the 50,000 students and teachers whose lives revolve around Seton Hall Law School, Rutgers University, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Essex County College and the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.
Once largely commuter schools, their academic buildings walled off from the surrounding city, these five institutions have been building furiously, constructing new dormitories that, by the fall semester, will house 4,000 students in and around downtown.
''People don't think of Newark as a college town, but I think that's about to change,'' said Gene A. Vincenti, executive vice provost at Rutgers-Newark, at the school's new $50 million administrative building, part of a $210 million capital improvement plan.
Up the hill from Rutgers, in a futuristic, four-story building, a biophysicist was busy working on a new ultraviolet system to treat psoriasis and purify drinking water, while a former telecommunications executive plotted the rollout of software that uses a computer-generated voice to read e-mail messages over the phone. Others in the so-called Newark Innovation Zone were creating facial recognition software for security firms and technologies that can detect biological agents in luggage.
Started 10 years ago, the zone -- also known as University Heights Science Park -- is one of three technology incubators in the state, with 60 start-ups and scores of lone entrepreneurs who enjoy cheap office space, free business advice and monthly networking lunches. There is a waiting list of several months, so this year organizers plan to build another 100,000-square-foot building, christened the Digital Century Center. A separate stem-cell research center is on the drawing board.
The lofty dream, those running the incubator say, is to turn the surrounding area into a high-tech manufacturing zone that could employ thousands of people. ''The idea is to make these things here, and create more than just jobs for a bunch of Ph.D.'s and their secretarial and janitorial support staff,'' said Donald H. Sebastian a vice president of the New Jersey Institute of Technology, the center's main sponsor.
But with almost a third of Newark's residents living in poverty, and the city's unemployment rate at 10 percent -- more than double New York City's rate and more than double New Jersey's average -- cynicism about such ideas abounds.
Ronnie Addy, who said he never finished high school and spent a year in jail for gun possession more than a decade ago, said he would ''love to work in an office'' someday, but has more or less given up looking for a job and survives on public assistance. ''I can't make ends meet flipping burgers and making minimum wage,'' said Mr. Addy, 44.
An associate professor of management and global business at Rutgers, dt ogilvie, said many of the chronically unemployed here needed the most basic training: how to dress for an interview, how to speak to an employer and how to handle disputes without storming out the door. ''We have plenty of willing workers in Newark,'' he said; ''a lot of them are just not equipped to work.''
Indeed, down at the waterfront, where the business of unloading and loading cargo has doubled in the past decade, producing about 1,000 new jobs a year, nearly 80 percent of the 28,000 stevedore and truck driving positions are held by people who live outside the city. At Newark Liberty International Airport, the airlines hire hundreds of baggage handlers, flight attendants and reservation agents every month; few are from Newark.
Mayor Booker insists that City Hall will not ignore the city's poorest residents and frequently says he is trying to make the rehabilitation of former offenders like Mr. Addy a top priority.
With 1,500 to 2,000 parolees returning to Newark each year -- and 60 percent of them ending up in handcuffs again within three years, according to city officials -- the Booker administration plans to unveil a program next month that would provide ex-felons with job training and help them expunge their criminal records.
During a recent City Hall meeting, when Mr. Pryor gushed about a flood of calls from potential investors, his counterpart in charge of minority economic empowerment, Michelle Thomas, flashed an expression of concern.
''I'm worried people in the Central Ward will be upset if we emphasize downtown housing,'' Ms. Thomas said of the neighborhood that took the most damage from the 1967 riots. ''It's semantic, but people will care and there's potential for a backlash.''
Nodding, Mr. Booker said, ''We don't want to gentrify people out of the city,'' but he added that ''creating a 24/7 community means providing retail and jobs and these will be opportunities for Newark residents.''
From the antiseptic hush of the high-tech park on its northern tip to the Hotel Riviera, where $10 buys a room for an hour, two miles south, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard is a jagged montage of Newark's grand history, nightmarish depths and nascent revival.
Not far from the Riviera, and an abandoned housing project occupied by a small army of squatters, sits Hopewell Baptist Church, a 3,000-seat behemoth known to another generation as Temple B'nai Jeshurun. The Rev. Jason C. Guice struggles to keep the rain from destroying Hopewell's organ and to stop the termites from chewing the cherry-wood pews; last year, the sanctuary's huge Star of David chandelier shattered on the floor. The congregation runs a soup kitchen that feeds 300 people every Saturday, a nursing school for young women and a day care center for their children.
''We haven't really arrived yet, but we're on our way,'' Mr. Guice said of both Newark and his church.
Mrs. Whigham, the funeral home owner, left Newark a few years ago for Livingston, an affluent suburb nine miles northwest.
Yes, she said, she has appreciated the tranquillity of sleeping behind windows without bars. But she misses the energy and rich history of her High Street.
''This place is in my blood,'' she said.
Mrs. Whigham plans to turn one of the four brownstones her family owns on the boulevard into a mortuary-science school. And, this month, she plans to sell her house in Livingston and move back into the apartment above the funeral home.

Jeb Bush and was in charge a year ago when Martin Lee Anderson, 14, died a day after being admitted to a juvenile boot camp in Panama City. In November, seven guards and a nurse were charged with manslaughter in connection with Martin's death. Mr. McNeil, a Democrat, said he would balance prevention and treatment programs with punishment.

By refusing to allow radio antennas atop their water tank towers, several water districts are blocking completion of Nassau County's new $50 million emergency communications system linking police, fire and ambulance agencies, county officials said yesterday. The project was prompted by the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, which underscored flawed communications in New York City.

C. Harry Falk, the chief executive and president of the New York Board of Trade, died Wednesday. He was 66 and lived in Rockland County in New York.

C. Harry Falk, the chief executive and president of the New York Board of Trade, died Wednesday. He was 66 and lived in Rockland County in New York.
The exchange announced his death but did not disclose a cause.
Mr. Falk was named chief executive and president of the exchange in 2003. He had been associated with the Board of Trade and its predecessor organizations since 1970. He became the chairman of the exchange's board in 2000 and helped guide it after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
When the World Trade Center was bombed in 1993, the exchange was at 4 World Trade Center and it was forced to close for two weeks. After the bombing, the exchange began looking for a backup site and, in 1996, it secured space in Long Island City, Queens, at a cost of $300,000 a year.
Some questioned the expense. But after the 2001 attacks destroyed the exchange's offices, still at 4 World Trade Center, its traders shifted to the backup operation. It was the only financial exchange to lose its trading floor in the attacks, but because of the backup site, it was the first to reopen.
Mr. Falk was long associated with sugar, one of the many commodities that are traded on the exchange, which opened in 1870 as the New York Cotton Exchange. It is a floor-based exchange with open-outcry trading.
Mr. Falk grew up in Middle Village, Queens. In 1958, while still a teenager, he began working as a clerk for Czarnikow-Rionda, a sugar broker. The company's Cuban assets were nationalized after Fidel Castro took power the next year, so it began to trade sugar from other Caribbean islands. Mr. Falk rose to become a partner in the firm.
In 1982, he moved to Richco Sugar, and two years later to the Louis Dreyfus Corporation.
Mr. Falk became a member of the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in 1970 and later became its chairman. During his tenure, in 1997, the exchange began a process that led to its merger in 2004 with the New York Cotton Exchange to form the New York Board of Trade. It trades commodities like cotton, ethanol, orange juice and sugar, as well as currency, index futures and options.
At the time of the merger, Mr. Falk said, ''While it is somewhat sad to see both the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange and the New York Cotton Exchange disappear and become simply a part of our history, we must move forward and embrace change in a manner which contributes to the vitality and expansion of our markets.''
Last September, Mr. Falk helped engineer the merger of the New York Board of Trade and the all-electronic International Continental Exchange, a deal valued at $1 billion. The merger preserved the open-outcry trading, but it also brought electronic trading to the exchange.
He is survived by his wife, Joan; 5 children; and 12 grandchildren.

Racing against a proposed state law that would limit paint manufacturers' liability for lead poisoning in aging neighborhoods, Cincinnati has joined five other Ohio cities in filing suits that seek millions of dollars from the companies to clean up lead paint.
Ohio is the latest front in a battle that pits paint companies against cities and states struggling to overcome problems associated with lead poisoning.
Ohio is the latest front in a battle that pits paint companies against cities and states struggling to overcome problems associated with lead poisoning.
Racing against a proposed state law that would limit paint manufacturers' liability for lead poisoning in aging neighborhoods, Cincinnati has joined five other Ohio cities in filing suits that seek millions of dollars from the companies to clean up lead paint.
Ohio is the latest front in a battle that pits paint companies against cities and states struggling to overcome problems associated with lead poisoning.
The problems include learning impairment in children, high blood pressure in adults and, at high levels of exposure, seizures, comas and deaths.
Municipal and county governments in California, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey and Texas have also sued major manufacturers seeking what would amount to billions of dollars in damages.
Whether responsibility rests primarily with paint companies, landlords who let paint deteriorate or cities that fail to enforce housing codes remains an open question.
Rhode Island broke new ground in February by winning a jury trial that found that three paint companies had created a public nuisance and had to clean up lead-paint contamination throughout the state at an estimated cost of $1.37 billion to $3.74 billion.
The companies are seeking a new trial there and trying to fend off litigation throughout the country. They are Sherwin-Williams, based in Cleveland; NL Industries, part of Valhi of Dallas and whose predecessor National Lead made Dutch Boy paint; and Millennium Holdings of Hunt Valley, Md., a successor to a company that owned Glidden Paint, originally based in Cleveland.
''The movement is gaining steam,'' Jack McConnell, the lead lawyer in the Ohio lawsuits and a participant in the Rhode Island trial, said. ''We've seen it both in the Rhode Island trial and in three or four appellate court decisions, all of which have ruled against the lead-paint industry.''
Lawyers for paint companies say such suits unjustifiably shift responsibility from the cities that failed to enforce housing codes that would have kept lead paint from deteriorating and affecting residents.
''Did the companies know that lead was toxic?'' asked Bonnie Campbell, who represents several paint manufacturers. ''Sure, everybody knew that. What wasn't known was that property owners wouldn't take care of their property.''
Ms. Campbell noted that most manufacturers voluntarily began removing lead from their products in 1955, when problems became apparent.
In Ohio, Gov. Bob Taft decided on Friday to allow a bill to become law without his signature that will ban future suits like those filed by the cities that are based on public nuisance grounds. Plaintiffs will instead have to rely on product liability law, which requires proof linking lead paint in a given home to a specific manufacturer. Noneconomic damages, including punitive damages, will be capped at $5,000 a consumer, instead of being unlimited.
Mr. Taft said that provision prevented him from signing the bill because the cap was too low.

The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to use the case of a schizophrenic death row inmate in Texas to set the standard for determining when a mental illness is so severe that execution would be constitutionally impermissible.
The question is not a new one for the court or for the criminal justice system, but it has come to the fore recently as a growing number of legal and mental health organizations have joined a call for a moratorium on executing those whose rational judgment has been significantly impaired, including their ability to appreciate why they have been sentenced to death.
The case will set the standard for determining when a mental illness is so severe that execution would be constitutionally impermissible.
The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to use the case of a schizophrenic death row inmate in Texas to set the standard for determining when a mental illness is so severe that execution would be constitutionally impermissible.
The question is not a new one for the court or for the criminal justice system, but it has come to the fore recently as a growing number of legal and mental health organizations have joined a call for a moratorium on executing those whose rational judgment has been significantly impaired, including their ability to appreciate why they have been sentenced to death.
The American Psychiatric Association has expressed specific concern about the competency standard used by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which upheld the death sentence for the Texas inmate, Scott L. Panetti, in rejecting his petition for a writ of habeas corpus last May.
Mr. Panetti, convicted in 1992 of fatally shooting his in-laws in the presence of his estranged wife and their 3-year-old child, is a 48-year-old Navy veteran who was hospitalized 14 times for schizophrenia and other serious mental disorders in the decade before the crime. A jury nonetheless found him competent to stand trial, and the judge permitted him to represent himself.
The Supreme Court ruled in 1986 that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment barred the execution of the mentally ill. But the justices who decided that case, Ford v. Wainwright, did not settle on a definition of mental illness for the purpose of determining competency for execution.
Most lower courts have adopted, as controlling, a separate opinion by Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., who said that the ''retributive goal of the criminal law'' was satisfied as long as defendants were aware of ''the punishment they are about to suffer'' and ''why they are to suffer it.''
The Fifth Circuit, which supervises the courts in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, has boiled this down to what it calls an ''awareness'' test. In Mr. Panetti's case, Panetti v. Quarterman, No. 06-6407, the appeals court found the test was satisfied because Mr. Panetti indicated that he understood the state's intention to execute him for killing his wife's parents. The fact that he also held the delusional belief that his execution was part of a conspiracy by which the state was trying to prevent him from preaching the Gospel was beside the point, the appeals court said.
In Mr. Panetti's appeal to the Supreme Court, his lawyers argue that the appeals court has distorted Justice Powell's meaning by failing to take the delusions into account. ''The moral force of retribution is lost if an inmate believes that his execution is being carried out through a conspiracy of demonic forces rather than as a lawful punishment for a horrific crime,'' their brief argues.
In a brief urging the justices to accept the appeal, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, an advocacy organization, said ''this case exemplifies why mere 'awareness,' the test applied by the Fifth Circuit, is not a meaningful requirement for determining whether to execute prisoners who are severely mentally ill.''
The brief said the test ''makes no sense when applied to a prisoner who is plagued by delusions of grand persecution.''
At his trial, Mr. Panetti was often incoherent and tried to issue subpoenas to Jesus, the pope and John F. Kennedy.
The justices' decision to hear his appeal was the latest indication of the Supreme Court's concern about the administration of capital punishment. In recent years, the court has declared unconstitutional the execution of mentally retarded defendants as well as those who committed murder before the age of 18. Some opponents of the death penalty have described mental illness as the next frontier in the debate.
Mr. Panetti's case was one of seven new appeals the court granted on a busy day as the justices returned from a four-week recess. The cases will be heard on dates yet to be determined in March and April.
Among the other new cases were appeals by the Bush administration and the National Association of Home Builders in a case that lies at the intersection between the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act. The question is whether the Endangered Species Act limits the government's discretion to transfer certain authority over pollution permits from federal agencies to the individual states, as the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found.
The twin appeals, consolidated for a single argument, are National Association of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife, No. 06-340, and United States Environmental Protection Agency v. Defenders of Wildlife, No. 05-549.
With two significant environmental cases already having been argued in the last three months, the term figures to be one of the most consequential in years for environmental law.

One of China's largest newspapers has filed a lawsuit against one of the country's leading Internet portals claiming that it violated copyright laws, setting off a media war and highlighting the first signs of a possible shift in policies toward intellectual property rights here.
In the suit, which was filed in October and is expected to go to court soon, the newspaper, The Beijing News, is seeking $400,000 in damages from a popular Internet site called Tom.com, alleging that it has copied and republished more than 25,000 articles and photos without authorization since 2003.
A copyright lawsuit by one of China’s largest newspapers is setting off a media war that may shift policies toward intellectual property rights.
One of China's largest newspapers has filed a lawsuit against one of the country's leading Internet portals claiming that it violated copyright laws, setting off a media war and highlighting the first signs of a possible shift in policies toward intellectual property rights here.
In the suit, which was filed in October and is expected to go to court soon, the newspaper, The Beijing News, is seeking $400,000 in damages from a popular Internet site called Tom.com, alleging that it has copied and republished more than 25,000 articles and photos without authorization since 2003.
China has long had the reputation as a sort of no man's land for intellectual property rights, with companies in virtually every industry freely copying designs and other content from foreign companies and domestic rivals with little fear of punishment.
The lawsuit, however, is headed to court at a time of accelerating legal change and signs of increased efforts by law enforcement to protect copyrights and intellectual property. It is also a critical time for China's newspaper industry, which grew explosively in the last decade or so but now faces an even faster-growing rival: Internet-based news media.
Now, as in the United States and many other countries, with computer use and broadband access booming here, newspapers are losing readers to large, corporate-owned Web sites. What had set China apart from much of the rest of the world until recently was that these Web sites faced no legal obstacles in copying material from newspapers, often wholesale.
''There is a very brutal competition between newspapers -- with seven or eight big ones just in Beijing -- and now a big, new player, the Internet, wants to wipe them all out, to change the landscape,'' said Yu Guofu, a lawyer who specializes in intellectual property. ''The press is leading a hard life and facing an unpleasant future, but it has decided it is better to protect its rights than just sit and wait to die.''
According to one recent study, newspaper readership in China has declined sharply in the last three years, with the number of people who say they read a newspaper at least once a week falling to 22 percent last year from 26 percent in 2003.
A major presumed cause for the decline is that big Internet content providers, or portals, have become one-stop sources for all manner of information, including news, entertainment and blogs.
Until recently, the general practice for most portals was to lift news and other information directly from other sources, sometimes crediting the original source and sometimes not, but rarely paying for the information.
The Beijing News lawsuit was filed a little more than a year after a meeting of major newspaper publishers in Nanjing at which strategies were discussed to shore up the industry's base and combat the leeching of content and readers by Internet companies.
''In terms of the law, things are quite clear, that Tom's use of Beijing News's work without authorization clearly violates Beijing News's copyrights,'' said Yu Guoming, dean of the school of journalism at Renmin University in Beijing. ''There are lots and lots of cases very similar to this one, but with this lawsuit, the traditional media is sending a very clear signal to the electronic media that their free lunch is over.''
A spokesman for Tom.com, Tu Jianglu, denied any violations. ''As a big company we respect copyright and property rights,'' he said. ''I can only say that there are other facts that make this more complicated.''
The Beijing News declined to comment on the lawsuit.
Until recently, China's laws have generally been anything but clear on intellectual property, and have made it difficult to win a suit over an alleged infringement. Such an environment may have served China's needs earlier in its industrial takeoff, when its industries were straining to catch up with the West.
The battle in the news media reflects part of a shift in the intellectual property landscape as China's growing place in world trade has brought strong new pressures to rein in wholesale piracy. Many of the country's largest Internet companies, for example, are listed on foreign stock exchanges, making them liable for lawsuits filed abroad.
Zhang Xin, a spokesman for Sohu.com, a leading portal, said, ''We've signed agreements with over 1,000 traditional news organizations in China, which means that if we use their articles or reports, we definitely have reached prior agreement with them.''
An awareness also seems to be taking hold here that Chinese companies must build strong brands of their own to succeed and that they cannot do so in an environment where copying goes unpunished.
''To enhance the country's development we are trying to encourage innovation,'' said Xu Chao, vice director of the National Copyright Bureau, a government agency. ''We are placing more emphasis on intellectual property, and have made improvements in the law. It used to be possible for traditional media or Internet media to simply copy each other's work, but now this has been forbidden.''

Warsaw's new archbishop, Stanislaw W. Wielgus, caught in Eastern Europe's widening witch hunt for former Communist secret police informers, admitted Friday that he had collaborated with the Sluzba Bezpieczenstwa, or Security Service, known as the S.B.
''Before you today, I confess to the mistake committed by me years ago, just as I have confessed to the Holy Father,'' Bishop Wielgus said in an open letter to Polish Catholics. ''By the fact of this entanglement, I have damaged the church.''
Warsaw’s new archbishop admitted that he had collaborated with the Communist-era secret police.
Warsaw's new archbishop, Stanislaw W. Wielgus, caught in Eastern Europe's widening witch hunt for former Communist secret police informers, admitted Friday that he had collaborated with the Sluzba Bezpieczenstwa, or Security Service, known as the S.B.
''Before you today, I confess to the mistake committed by me years ago, just as I have confessed to the Holy Father,'' Bishop Wielgus said in an open letter to Polish Catholics. ''By the fact of this entanglement, I have damaged the church.''
He said he compounded that damage by denying ''facts of this cooperation'' in recent days.
Bishop Wielgus insisted, however, that he had neither spied on anyone nor harmed anyone. He said the only thing he ever did was to inform the secret police of his agenda during foreign academic meetings and to promise not to take part in anti-Communist activities.
He said it was up to Pope Benedict XVI to decide whether he would keep his new job, which he took up Friday.
The bishop is to be officially elevated to archbishop during a ceremony on Sunday in Warsaw at St. John's Cathedral, though many voices in Poland have called for him to step down.
The Warsaw archbishopric is a particularly symbolic institution in the former Soviet bloc. The Polish church, together with the Polish-born Pope John Paul II, were crucial supporters of the pro-democracy Solidarity movement, which helped bring down the totalitarian system and end the cold war.
Confirmation that the archbishop collaborated is doubly troubling because the Polish secret police murdered a charismatic anti-Communist priest from the archdiocese, the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, in 1984. Warsaw's departing archbishop, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, waged a quiet battle with the Communist Party in those years.
Many historians argue that a significant segment of the clergy in Poland and other Eastern bloc countries collaborated to varying degrees with the secret services. Priests have recently been added to those segments of society under scrutiny in several countries during recent efforts to expose former Communist collaborators.
Two years ago, files surfaced showing that the Rev. Mieczyslaw Malinski, who had been close to John Paul II, worked for the S.B. in the 1980s. Several other prominent priests have since been accused of having been informers, and some have admitted that they had links to the secret police. The Polish church publicly apologized last year for priests who collaborated with the S.B., but has tried to keep their names secret.
The uproar over Bishop Wielgus's past began shortly after Pope Benedict picked him in early December to succeed Cardinal Glemp as Warsaw's archbishop. A Polish daily newspaper, Gazeta Polska, reported Dec. 20 that the bishop, 67, had spied on dissidents and fellow clerics for more than two decades, until Communism collapsed in 1989.
Both Bishop Wielgus and the Vatican sought to deflect the accusations by saying his involvement with the secret police had been nothing out of the ordinary for people traveling abroad during the Communist era. Leading representatives of the Polish clergy denounced the accusations against him.
But Poland's human rights ombudsman, Janusz Kochanowski, said Thursday that there was evidence in the secret police archives that Bishop Wielgus had knowingly cooperated with Communist authorities. Rzeczpospolita, one of Poland's most respected newspapers, published documents showing that he had met with police agents more than 50 times in one five-year period.
Even Poland's Catholic Church Historical Commission issued a statement on Friday, saying, ''There are numerous, substantial documents confirming Stanislaw Wielgus's willingness for a conscious and secret cooperation with the Communist security forces.''
The commission said that there was no evidence that Bishop Wielgus's actions harmed anyone, and that the documents would be sent to the Vatican for further study.
Monsignor Wielgus first admitted Friday that he had signed a cooperation statement with the secret police in 1978 under pressure by a ''brutal intelligence officer'' when he was seeking permission to travel to Munich. ''That was my moment of weakness,'' he wrote.
But he accused the secret police of falsifying documents that cast him as a more eager, useful collaborator than he actually was.
''The personality ascribed to me in the intelligence service documents is so far from the truth that I would never have recognized myself,'' he wrote.
Those claims are not far-fetched. Almost from the moment the Iron Curtain fell, the nations of the former Communist bloc have been steeped in controversies over the files of their secret police forces. The documents are often elliptical and incomplete, and were sometimes embellished by secret police officers eager to impress their superiors, experts say.
The documents published by Rzeczpospolita and other newspapers suggest that Bishop Wielgus was recruited by the S.B. in 1967 when he was a philosophy student at the University of Lublin in eastern Poland, more than a decade before he signed the cooperation agreement. Newspapers cited other documents in which the S.B. claimed he had given them information about activities at the university, where he later served as a professor of medieval philosophy.
The newspapers claimed that some documents referred to Bishop Wielgus by the code names Grey, Adam and Adam Wysocki. They said he received training and was rewarded for his collaboration with a grant to study in Munich.
Later Friday, Bishop Wielgus issued another statement, which was broadcast by Vatican Radio's Polish service, in which he said he had collaborated so that he could travel abroad for his academic research.
''I'm not trying to justify anything, I know that I shouldn't have had any relations with the Communist regime's secret services,'' he said. ''At the time I thought I had to continue my important scientific research and acquire sound training for the good of the church.''
The Vatican has continued to support the embattled prelate.
''The Holy See, in deciding the nomination of the new archbishop of Warsaw, took into consideration all the circumstances of his life, including those regarding his past,'' the Vatican said in a statement on Friday, repeating the position it has taken for the past month.
The statement said Benedict ''has every confidence in Bishop Stanislaw Wielgus and in full conscience entrusted him the mission of pastor of the archdiocese of Warsaw.''

Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Friday appointed Asha-Rose Mtengeti-Migiro, the foreign minister of Tanzania, to be deputy secretary general and said he intended to give her responsibility for day-to-day management of the world organization.
In choosing Ms. Migiro, 50, a professor who has served for six years in Tanzania's cabinet, Mr. Ban fulfilled a pledge to place a woman from a developing country in the second most powerful post at the United Nations. In a statement, he praised her ''outstanding management skills'' and said he intended to delegate to her ''much of the administrative and management work of the Secretariat.''
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he intended to give Asha-Rose Mtengeti-Migiro responsibility for day-to-day management.
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Friday appointed Asha-Rose Mtengeti-Migiro, the foreign minister of Tanzania, to be deputy secretary general and said he intended to give her responsibility for day-to-day management of the world organization.
In choosing Ms. Migiro, 50, a professor who has served for six years in Tanzania's cabinet, Mr. Ban fulfilled a pledge to place a woman from a developing country in the second most powerful post at the United Nations. In a statement, he praised her ''outstanding management skills'' and said he intended to delegate to her ''much of the administrative and management work of the Secretariat.''
On Wednesday Mr. Ban, who took over as secretary general on Jan. 1, appointed Alicia Bárcena Ibarra, 54, a Mexican diplomat, to be the under secretary general for management, the top post focused exclusively on administration.
While some United States officials were unenthusiastic about Ms. Bárcena because of her lack of experience in financial management, they praised the choice of Ms. Migiro.
''Her experience indicates she will do a fantastic job,'' said Richard A. Grenell, the spokesman for the United States Mission. American officials said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was personally acquainted with Ms. Migiro and was pleased when she heard of the appointment on Friday.
Ms. Migiro has been Tanzania's foreign minister since January 2006, and before that she served for five years as minister for community development, gender and children. Over the past year she has played a leading role in efforts to resolve conflicts in central Africa.
As Mr. Ban started to build his team this week, African diplomats said they were pleased to hold on to one of the most influential posts after Kofi Annan, the former secretary general, who was from Ghana, stepped down.
''Women are multitasking people,'' said Dumisani S. Kumalo, the South African ambassador, who is a major player on behalf of developing nations. ''And African women are even better. Watch out!''
African diplomats said Ms. Migiro had carried out a management overhaul in the foreign ministry, requiring new standards of efficiency.
Some United Nations officials noted that Mr. Ban's choices signaled a step back from the corporate-style management reforms that Washington has pushed since the early 1990s. Neither Ms. Migiro nor Ms. Bárcena had substantial business experience. Mr. Ban made it clear that he would focus on diplomacy and did not intend to play the chief executive role, as some Americans had hoped.
But Ms. Migiro may help Mr. Ban to win new support for reform. ''The developing countries have seen the United States reforms as a way of taking control of the United Nations away from them,'' said Princeton N. Lyman, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. He said Ms. Migiro might be able to propose reforms ''in a way that does not seem threatening to them.''

The big powers in the United Nations Security Council chose Ban Ki-moon as secretary general because they wanted a low-key bureaucrat who wouldn't rock the boat. Judging by Mr. Ban's early moves, the world has gotten exactly that.
Expect no Kofi Annan-style exhortations to live up to the values of the U.N. charter. In commenting on the sordid execution of Saddam Hussein, Mr. Ban even managed to forget that the U.N. opposes the death penalty on principle. Expect no shift from patronage to selection based on merit for key staff positions. The top jobs in peacekeeping, political affairs and humanitarian relief are already being doled out to the favored candidates of London, Paris and Washington (three of Mr. Ban's backers).

And expect no serious drive for much-needed administrative reform. The top management job, previously held by a reform-minded American, has now been given to a long-serving insider, Alicia Bárcena Ibarra of Mexico.
Mr. Ban takes over at a difficult time. The secretariat's reputation for integrity has been battered by the oil-for-food scandal, and the Security Council's claim to influence has been battered by its failure to halt the genocide in Darfur or the nuclear ambitions of Iran and North Korea.
On one crucial front, though, the outlook may be brightening. Under President Bush, relations between Washington and the U.N. were driven to their lowest point ever, following the twin blows of the Iraq war and the destructive presence of the former ambassador, John Bolton. The White House reportedly plans to nominate a new ambassador, Zalmay Khalilzad, who actually believes in diplomacy.
Mr. Khalilzad is currently the ambassador in Baghdad, where he is one of the few American officials to try to reach out to Sunni Muslims and curb the divisively sectarian policies of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. Unfortunately, the White House -- desperate to make Mr. Maliki look like a leader -- decided it did not want such an activist ambassador. We hope that choosing Mr. Khalilzad for the United Nations is at least a sign that Mr. Bush is learning the importance of diplomacy and cooperation, if not the importance of a powerful U.N. leader or a strong-minded ambassador in Baghdad.

Re ''Senate Feels Heat as House Cranks Up Ethics Overhaul'' (news article, Jan. 5):
Democrats are doing the right thing morally and politically in pushing for far-reaching ethics reform. In addition to being good for our Republic by returning at least some of the power back to the voters and away from special interests, reform will be good for the Democratic Party.
It takes courage to compete for the support of the voters on the merit of one's ideas and not by stacking the deck with incumbency. For candidates to resist a fair and open debate is to admit that their ideas can't stand up to public scrutiny on their own.
Republicans showed themselves unable or unwilling to compete based on ideas alone.
While ethics reform will diminish the benefits of incumbency, and therefore put at risk the slim Democratic majority, recent history suggests that when playing on a level or semi-level playing field, Democratic ideas and priorities are supported by a majority of Americans.

You say quite confidently that ''the voters are watching, and lawmakers dare not slip away from the promise to clean up their act.'' What is it that you think these lawmakers are trembling in fear of, when most House races are still not competitive because of gerrymandering?
What we really need -- even more desperately than ethics reform -- is an independent, nonpartisan panel to draw legislative districts, so that every race is competitive in every election. Then and only then will the voters truly be able to hold their lawmakers accountable for their ethics.
Daniel Dickinson  Stanford, Calif., Jan. 4, 2007
To the Editor:
It is scandalous that the level of ethics in Congress has sunk so low that there is a need for you to call for the 110th Congress ''to clean up its own act.''
In opinion polls before the midterm elections last year, less than 40 percent of Americans gave Congress a high approval rating. But I don't think that those in Congress really care what the public thinks once they are elected.
Even your well-intentioned call for change does not go nearly far enough. I do not understand why instead of calling for a complete elimination of earmarks, you would merely require the ''full disclosure'' of their authorship, since the authors would ''be mocked by taxpayers.''
It is disappointing that you do not even put forth a reason earmarks are essential. I suggest that history shows that there would be little taxpayer mocking (in any event, being mocked is a very small price to pay for the value the authors receive for inserting billions of dollars of earmarks).
All expenditures of taxpayer money should be debated and voted on, not inserted into mammoth spending bills without debate -- even if the author's name and photograph are attached.

Yes, peace would be a blessing. It would realize Israel's yearning from its founding in 1948 for coexistence with its Arab neighbors. And it would give a new start to the Palestinian people, who for too long have been fed a misguided diet of all-or-nothing by their leaders.
But Mr. Scowcroft is wrong to believe that the conflict, even if it were ripe for resolution (a risky assumption given the current upper hand of Hamas, the internecine warfare between Hamas and Fatah, and the existential threats to Israel posed by a swaggering Iran and its regional proxies) would transform the region.
As the 2003 Arab Human Development Report noted, the region suffers from three foundational problems: a knowledge deficit, a gender deficit and a freedom deficit. In each of these areas, the report stressed, Arab nations lag far behind other countries.
It would be self-delusional to believe that the region's real challenges -- from corrupt, despotic regimes to fundamentalism; from the Shiite-Sunni split to human rights repression -- can be addressed by focusing on the Arab-Israeli conflict and not on these core issues.
David A. Harris  Executive Director  American Jewish Committee  New York, Jan. 4, 2007
To the Editor:
Brent Scowcroft is right on target when he calls for ''a vigorously renewed effort to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict.'' But his description of this effort doesn't mention two key groups: the two peoples and the Palestinian leadership.
The Joint Palestinian-Israeli Public Opinion Poll released on Dec. 25 finds a strong preference in both publics for the comprehensive settlement option, with 58 percent of the Israelis and 81 percent of the Palestinians supporting this track.
President Mahmoud Abbas seeks to negotiate with Israel, but Hamas, which heads the Palestinian legislature and cabinet, refuses to recognize Israel or renounce terror.
The renewed effort must therefore begin with measures, led by the United States, to strengthen the Abbas faction at the expense of those opposed to negotiations for peace.
This would also counteract the expansion of Iran's influence into the Palestinian territories through Hamas described by Mr. Scowcroft.

The writers are, respectively, president and executive director of the Israel Policy Forum.
To the Editor:
Brent Scowcroft suggests that a vigorous push for peace between Israel and its neighbors will lay the groundwork for stabilizing Iraq and ending centuries-old blood feuds among the Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds.
A few short years ago, we were told that a newly democratic Iraq would allow peace and harmony to bloom across the Middle East.
It is time to recognize the simple truth that the Iraqi morass and the Arab-Israeli conflict are two unrelated problems, each requiring and meriting its own attention and its own solution.
Daniel Wolf  Teaneck, N.J., Jan. 4, 2007
To the Editor:
Brent Scowcroft warns us as a nation that ''we cannot afford to fail that test'' of establishing a friendly government from the ashes of Saddam Hussein's authoritarian regime.
I think that we already sat down for that test, without studying or bringing our trusty No. 2 pencils, and failed.
We can keep sitting at the desk staring at our blank test sheet, but maybe it would be better if we just switched majors. International studies does not seem to be our forte.

The Palestinian prime minister, Ismail Haniya, called Friday for an end to the internal violence in the Gaza Strip, a day after members of his own Hamas militia surrounded the house of a Fatah commander, killed him and his bodyguards and seriously wounded his wife and brother.
Before his death, the commander, Col. Muhammad Gharib, begged for help on a live telephone call to Palestinian television, saying his home near Jabaliya was being attacked by the Executive Force, a parallel security force under the command of the Hamas-run Interior Ministry, but that Fatah leaders and fighters did not respond.
The Palestinian prime minister called for an end to the internal violence, after his own Hamas militia killed a Fatah commander.
The Palestinian prime minister, Ismail Haniya, called Friday for an end to the internal violence in the Gaza Strip, a day after members of his own Hamas militia surrounded the house of a Fatah commander, killed him and his bodyguards and seriously wounded his wife and brother.
Before his death, the commander, Col. Muhammad Gharib, begged for help on a live telephone call to Palestinian television, saying his home near Jabaliya was being attacked by the Executive Force, a parallel security force under the command of the Hamas-run Interior Ministry, but that Fatah leaders and fighters did not respond.
''They are killers,'' he said of the gunmen. ''They are targeting the house. Children are dying, they are bleeding. For God's sake, send an ambulance! We want an ambulance -- somebody move!''
On Friday, Fatah issued a statement suggesting another round of retaliation. ''All killers are legitimate targets,'' the statement said, adding, ''What is called the Executive Force is an enemy.''
The statement, confirmed by a Fatah official, Abdel-Hakim Awad, also said negotiations with Hamas on a unity government were impossible in the present atmosphere.
''There will be no dialogue in the midst of this series of killings and organized terrorism practiced by Hamas,'' the statement said, calling on the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, to fire Interior Minister Said Siam and disband the Executive Force.
''Said Siam is responsible for the execution and the cold-blooded murder to which our martyrs in Jabaliya were subjected,'' the statement said.
Mr. Abbas, who met with Mr. Haniya early Friday in an attempt to restore calm, tried to disband the Executive Force when it was established, but failed. Now it has about 6,000 men, including several hundred drawn from factions usually loyal to Mr. Abbas's Fatah movement.
Hamas officials said Colonel Gharib had been responsible for the deaths of two of their fighters.
Mr. Abbas has called for early parliamentary and presidential elections, a challenge to the Hamas government, which won parliamentary elections a year ago. Hamas has said it will not allow early elections, which it says are illegal, and has moved to enforce its hold over Gaza while calling for renewed talks on a unity government that Mr. Haniya would lead.
The new tensions have set off a series of battles between Hamas and Fatah forces that show no sign of ending, despite various efforts to restore calm.
There were emotional funerals on Friday for some of the dead from the attack on Thursday on Colonel Gharib's home. Two more people who had been wounded died Friday, bringing the total to eight. As a funeral cortege passed the colonel's blackened, shrapnel-riddled house, masked men fired guns into the air and shouted for revenge.
In Palestinian violence on Thursday, more than 60 people were wounded, including 10 children, Palestinian medics said. On Wednesday, five people died from violence.
On Friday a local cleric and frequent critic of Hamas, Adel Nasar, was murdered as he left his mosque, witnesses told The Associated Press.
There was no claim of responsibility in the death of Mr. Nasar, who was not openly affiliated with any political party, though he often spoke against Hamas in his sermons. In his sermon on Friday, Mr. Nasar warned that God would punish the killers of Colonel Gharib and his bodyguards, as well as the Palestinian rulers for not putting the rule of God into effect, witnesses said.
Speaking in another mosque on Friday, Mr. Haniya called for Palestinian guns to be aimed at Israelis, not other Palestinians. ''Our fight is not an internal one, it's against the occupation,'' he said. But it is increasingly clear that Mr. Haniya, although prime minister, does not have operational control over many of the Hamas gunmen, just as Mr. Abbas cannot control Fatah-affiliated militias.
As in Iraq, the division of power created by democratic elections, in the absence of a traditional powerful state or after the disappearance of one, has meant the continuation of party politics through armed militias affiliated with factions but not always controlled by them.
In the West Bank on Friday, Fatah supporters celebrated an anniversary by attending the weekly demonstration against Israel's separation barrier in the town of Bilin, where the barrier cuts off the village from much of its farmland.
The demonstrators are a mixture of Palestinians, Israelis and foreigners, and as usual, what was supposed to be a nonviolent protest turned into exchanges of rocks, rubber-coated bullets and tear gas with the Israeli Army and the border police.
Ten demonstrators were wounded, and two were hospitalized. Jibril Rajoub, a Fatah member and former security chief, said, ''Our battle with Hamas is not a battle of assassination, kidnapping or revenge.''
''Our battle is with the occupation, not with each other,'' he added.
According to Reuters, the Bush administration is asking Congress for $86 million in aid, not including weapons and ammunition, to bolster Mr. Abbas and his Presidential Guard. The aid, mostly training and supplies, according to an American document obtained by Reuters, is intended ''to dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism and establish law and order in the West Bank and Gaza.'' Officials said previously that they expected to ask for nearly $100 million for the effort, which has itself been widely reported.
In Israel, there were recriminations over a failed army arrest raid in the center of the West Bank city of Ramallah on Thursday, hours before Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was to meet President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. The wanted man, though wounded, escaped, and four Palestinians were killed as Israeli forces exchanged fire with Palestinians in violent scenes that were televised live on Al Jazeera.
Mr. Olmert's aides said he had not been informed of the raid in advance and was angry about what had happened. The violence overshadowed the summit meeting, which Olmert aides said had gone well.
Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, an Israeli cabinet member and former defense minister, criticized the timing of the raid. ''I don't think this operation should have been carried out on the day of a visit by the Israeli prime minister to a country in which we have a supreme strategic interest,'' he told Israel Radio. ''Our relations with Egypt are more important to us than anything else.''

The State Department's top diplomat for Africa plans to visit Mogadishu, the violence-scarred Somali capital, on Sunday, American officials said Friday. It would be the first time in more than a decade that a high-ranking United States official has set foot there.
But Al Qaeda's second-in-command, Ayman al-Zawahri, urged the world's Muslims on Friday to turn Somalia into a battlefield and use suicide attacks.
Jendayi E. Frazer’s visit would be the first time in more than a decade that a high-ranking U.S. official has set foot in Mogadishu.
The State Department's top diplomat for Africa plans to visit Mogadishu, the violence-scarred Somali capital, on Sunday, American officials said Friday. It would be the first time in more than a decade that a high-ranking United States official has set foot there.
But Al Qaeda's second-in-command, Ayman al-Zawahri, urged the world's Muslims on Friday to turn Somalia into a battlefield and use suicide attacks.
These developments were part of Somalia's transformation after Ethiopian-led forces ousted the once powerful Islamist movement from the capital last week and helped install a potentially viable government there for the first time in over 16 years.
American officials said the schedule for the diplomat, Jendayi E. Frazer, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, was still tentative, but that she planned to be in Mogadishu for four hours to meet with officials of the transitional government and leading Somali intellectuals.
The United States has had a minimal presence in the country since its diplomats were withdrawn in the fall of 1994, nearly a year after 18 Americans were killed during an ill-fated attempt to capture a warlord in Mogadishu. In his speech on Friday, Mr. Zawahri urged Muslim fighters to wage a holy guerrilla war in Somalia. ''I speak to you today as the crusader Ethiopian invasion forces violate the soil of the beloved Muslim Somalia,'' he said in an audio recording on a Web site that has featured Qaeda messages before. ''Launch ambushes, land mines, raids and suicidal attacks until you consume them as the lions eat their prey.''
It was not the first time that Muslim extremists have called for a holy war in Somalia.
Ethiopia has a long Christian history, and Somalia's Islamist leaders had been trying for months to rally outside support by portraying the Ethiopians as infidel invaders and urging Muslims worldwide to turn Somalia into the third front for jihad, after Iraq and Afghanistan.
In the end, though, Western intelligence officials said that only a few hundred foreign fighters heeded the call, and that they seemed to make little difference. The Islamist forces, made up of mostly untrained teenage troops, were routed by Ethiopian soldiers in one battle after another and lost in one week all the territory they had gained in the past six months.
Somalia's transitional government is now in loose control of most of the country and Western diplomats, including Ms. Frazer, are urging African nations to quickly put together a peacekeeping force before Somalia reverts to anarchy.
Officials from Ethiopia, one of the poorest nations in the world, have said that they do not have the resources to keep soldiers here much longer. Ethiopia has justified its intervention by saying that Somalia's Islamists were a regional menace.
Ms. Frazer met Friday with Kenyan and Somali officials in Nairobi to discuss the details of the peacekeeping force. Uganda has already volunteered troops, and Nigeria, South Africa and Tanzania have indicated they might also send forces.
Ms. Frazer was to travel to Yemen and Djibouti on Saturday to pursue the matter.
In Mogadishu, the transitional government was struggling to collect weapons. Earlier in the week, Ali Muhammad Gedi, the transitional prime minister, announced that Thursday was the deadline for all militias and gunmen to surrender their arms. Only a handful have complied and the deadline has been pushed back to Saturday.
As for the Islamists, Somali officials said Friday that the last remnants of their forces were cornered in a remote area of southern Somalia, south of Kismayo. Somali officials said they expected the conflict to end soon, though the Islamists have vowed to fight on as an underground insurgency.

Gov. Eliot Spitzer is fond of saying that you can't change the world by whispering. What New Yorkers saw in his first week in office was a governor in full trumpet about how to overhaul their state government. While some veterans of state politics saw Mr. Spitzer's State of the State speech on Wednesday as too ambitious, former Gov. Hugh Carey got it just right. ''It's a very big agenda,'' he said, ''but it's not too big for New York.''
We are still in the promising stage, of course, and the real test will begin later this month with Mr. Spitzer's first executive budget. But he has begun by laying down a number of important, and sensible, markers. On health care, he wants insurance for all children. He hopes to find some of the money to do this by consolidating hospitals and shifting patients from nursing homes to at-home care.

But he has begun by laying down a number of important, and sensible, markers. On health care, he wants insurance for all children. He hopes to find some of the money to do this by consolidating hospitals and shifting patients from nursing homes to at-home care.
On education, Mr. Spitzer says he wants to spread money out more fairly to students who most need it. Suburban lawmakers whose schools are favored by the current formula will object. But he may win them over with his plan to lower property taxes that fall heavily on middle-class suburbanites.
He made a strong pitch for economic revitalization upstate, a familiar but elusive goal of a long line of New York politicians.
Mr. Spitzer also proposed a series of reforms that are certain to rile legislators accustomed to lifetime tenure in Albany. He intends to create a nonpartisan redistricting commission and vowed to veto any future district lines that are gerrymandered to make elections uncompetitive. And he wants to ''replace the weakest campaign finance laws in the nation with the strongest.'' That means lowering contribution limits and providing public financing so that moneyed interests can no longer buy political clout.
Also on Mr. Spitzer's ambitious to-do list, and appropriately so, are restructuring the courts and organizing the overlapping local governments across the state.
Mr. Spitzer faces two major hurdles. One is finding top-flight appointees to make these proposals a reality. One of the most important sales jobs he has now is convincing enough good people that working for government wages is worth it to help reinvent such a powerful state government. Mr. Spitzer's other challenge will be getting the Legislature to go along. Much of his speech was met with an odd silence from lawmakers. Perhaps it was the way Mr. Spitzer carved out new political territory that does not entirely cater to upstate Republicans or downstate Democrats. But it may simply be that they do not yet know what to make of all that urgency, all those promises, all that work.
Mr. Spitzer certainly acts like a man ready to go forward quickly. The goals he has set may be daunting to the old guard in Albany, but anything less from this governor would have been a grave disappointment.

In a scathing attack of the American-led war in Iraq, President Jacques Chirac said Friday that his predictions that the war would spread chaos and more terrorism had come true.
''As France had foreseen and feared, the war in Iraq has sparked upheavals that have yet to show their full effects,'' Mr. Chirac said in his New Year's address at Élysée Palace to the foreign diplomatic corps.
President Jacques Chirac said his predictions that the war would spread chaos and more terrorism had come true.
In a scathing attack of the American-led war in Iraq, President Jacques Chirac said Friday that his predictions that the war would spread chaos and more terrorism had come true.
''As France had foreseen and feared, the war in Iraq has sparked upheavals that have yet to show their full effects,'' Mr. Chirac said in his New Year's address at Élysée Palace to the foreign diplomatic corps.
''This adventure has worsened the divisions among communities and threatened the very integrity of Iraq,'' he said. ''It has undermined the stability of the entire region, where every country now fears for its security and its independence. It has offered terrorism a new field for expansion.''
As President Bush prepares to unveil next week a new military strategy in Iraq, Mr. Chirac added that ''the priority, more than ever, is to restore full sovereignty to the Iraqi people.''
The single paragraph on Iraq in a speech that addressed many crises and problems around the world was one of Mr. Chirac's most pointed justifications for France's decision to oppose the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
In a sense, the attack was surprising. France's opposition to the war set off a crisis in French-American relations that has since eased, thanks to close cooperation between the United States and France to resolve the summer's Israeli-Hezbollah war and to curb Iran's nuclear program.
As the violence and chaos in Iraq steadily worsened, despite the presence of American troops, the 74-year-old French president tended to avoid reminding the United States of its failures there.
After Mr. Bush's re-election, for example, Mr. Chirac sent him a handwritten ''Cher George'' letter of congratulations. He also gave a speech expressing hope that 2005 would be a year of ''trust'' with Mr. Bush, and congratulated him again after elections took place in Iraq.
In Mr. Chirac's last speech to the foreign diplomatic corps, a year ago, he expressed hope that Iraqi elections would help unify Iraqis.
But as Mr. Chirac seems unlikely to run for a third term in presidential elections this spring, he may feel he has little to lose in being blunt in defending what some French political analysts call the high point of his foreign policy in his 12-year presidency.
In Friday's speech, Mr. Chirac also attacked ''the pitfalls of unilateralism,'' a veiled criticism of the Bush administration for going to war in Iraq without the backing of the United Nations Security Council.
He repeated his approval of the emergence of a ''multipolar world'' as countries like China, India and Brazil assume ''the status of global powers.'' The term enrages the Bush administration because it seems to envision a power that competes with American interests and influence.

Another winter storm bore down on snow-weary Colorado on Friday, complicating the recovery from back-to-back blizzards in December and raising fears that livestock losses would continue to mount.
At least 1,000 head of cattle were confirmed dead, most of them smothered by drifts when they bunched together along fence lines.
The six to eight inches of snow, predicted for Colorado through early Saturday, was a reminder of how wildly divergent the nation’s weather has become this winter.
Another winter storm bore down on snow-weary Colorado on Friday, complicating the recovery from back-to-back blizzards in December and raising fears that livestock losses would continue to mount.
At least 1,000 head of cattle were confirmed dead, most of them smothered by drifts when they bunched together along fence lines.
''This is far from over,'' said Don Ament, the state's agriculture commissioner.
The latest storm was a pallid reflection of the two holiday-week behemoths that brought as much as four feet of snow between them to parts of the Denver area and shut down Denver International Airport for two days during the peak travel period just before Christmas.
But even an additional six to eight inches of snow, predicted through early Saturday, was a reminder of how wildly divergent the nation's weather has become this winter, with East Coast residents in shirtsleeves and sandals while people here and across the Plains and Southwest are overwhelmed by reminders of the season's potential for havoc.
A spokeswoman for the Colorado Division of Emergency Management, Polly White, said the biggest concern in the state's hard-hit southeast corner on Friday was wind. Across an eight-county area, 25 percent of the roads were still impassable a week after the last storm, Ms. White said, and gusts up to 35 miles per hour were predicted from the new one.
Bad weather grounded Colorado National Guard flights that had been dropping hay to cattle stranded by drifts as high as 15 feet in places like Prowers County on the Kansas border, Ms. White said. Relief efforts were continuing on Friday using tractors and four-wheel-drive trucks.
''We're hoping that the winds predicted in the southeast don't blow the snow back over and cover the roads,'' Ms. White said. ''Then we're starting over.''
But the pictures on television of buried cars, collapsed roofs, disgruntled travelers and worried farmers also belie the mixed impact of the weather.
The snow cost Denver's airport as much as $11 million, according to preliminary estimates by airport administrators, mainly for cleanup and lost revenue from canceled flights. But many Denver hotels had their best December in years as stranded travelers and downtown office workers took shelter.
Cattle losses could rise into the tens of millions of dollars, farm experts said, perhaps even approaching the estimated $28 million in farm-animal deaths in a blizzard in 1997. But winter wheat farmers, whose lands have been parched by years of drought, were exulting. The deep snows, they say, will almost certainly produce the best crop in years.
Ski resort operators said that thousands of visitors were kept away from the slopes during the storms by the closed airport and the bad roads, but that news coverage of Denver's plight during those same snowbound hours had also proved to be the kind of advertising money cannot buy, prompting a surge of reservations and telephone calls.
The Aspen Skiing Company, which operates four resorts around Aspen in central Colorado, had 3,000 to 4,000 fewer skier-days through the Christmas week than expected, with each skier-day worth $50 to $75, said Jeff Hanle, a company spokesman.
''But the reservation center had some of the busiest days ever,'' Mr. Hanle added. ''It gave us a real blip for February and March bookings.''
And the storms also revealed, residents and local officials say, how much the political and demographic pattern of the West continues to evolve.
Agriculture, while still important to Colorado's economy, is increasingly dwarfed by the clout of Denver and its suburbs, which swallowed up most of the available snow-removal equipment and worsened the trouble on ranches and farms.
Since 1997, when the last great blizzard hit cow-country Colorado, the number of cattle statewide has fallen by 25 percent, to around three million from about four million, according to the State Agriculture Department.
''A lot of the equipment isn't available to go out to the rural areas because it's contracted to the cities,'' said Barry Cooper, the president and chief executive of Farm Credit of Southern Colorado, a bank in Colorado Springs that specializes in agriculture.
Insurance concerns have compounded the disparity, Mr. Cooper said, since municipalities have the resources to protect snow-removal contractors from liability, while rural areas with lots of private ranch roads mostly do not.
But life was grinding back to normal, even in the snowiest spots.
Jason Dittburner, 33, who drives a 150-mile-a-day route through Southeast Colorado in a Hostess-Wonder Bread van, delivering supplies to grocers, was back on the job on Wednesday, the first day roads were clear enough to make his route since Dec. 29, and Dorothy Grano, for one, was happy to see him.
''The shelves were getting pretty empty,'' said Ms. Grano, the assistant manager of the Rocky Ford Mini-Mart, about two-and-a-half hours south of Denver, as Mr. Dittburner walked in with his racks of bread, snack cakes and fruit pies.
Ranchers say the next worry on the horizon is calving season, which is just beginning.
Dale Butler, who manages about 700 head of cattle near the Kansas border for himself and a partner, said in a telephone interview that his cows were expecting about 350 calves between now and early April, and that he had lost six so far in the cold snap that followed the snows.
''It was so cold they wouldn't try to get up to nurse,'' Mr. Butler said.

Hours after casting his first votes in Congress, Representative Zack Space still beamed with excitement on Thursday, showing off the identification card that doubles as an electronic balloting device.
''I had to ask someone how to use it,'' he said, proudly whisking the card out of its carrying case as he gave his family a tour of the Capitol.
The wave of newcomers to Washington was most palpable in the House, where the dozens of arrivals circulated through welcome parties and herded their families on tours.
Hours after casting his first votes in Congress, Representative Zack Space still beamed with excitement on Thursday, showing off the identification card that doubles as an electronic balloting device.
''I had to ask someone how to use it,'' he said, proudly whisking the card out of its carrying case as he gave his family a tour of the Capitol.
Back in his office, a new receptionist apologized for hanging up on someone who called. ''Sorry, second day on the job,'' she chirped.
Even before his arrival in Washington this week, Mr. Space, 45, typified the incoming freshman class: A Democrat from Ohio, he campaigned hard on the issue of ethics reform in a race to succeed Representative Bob Ney, who pleaded guilty in a corruption case. Despite his political inexperience -- and the fact that Democratic officials considered him one of their weakest candidates -- Mr. Space beat his Republican rival, in an increasingly Republican district, 62 percent to 38 percent.
Now, he is one of 66 new members of the 110th Congress, part of a historic Democratic tide that swept Republicans from power after a dozen years and left President Bush on the defensive.
Although Mr. Space at times exudes a certain good-natured goofiness -- his campaign Web logo featured a starry rendering of outer space, and one of his mottos is a riff on his father's first name, Socrates (''being the son of Socrates, Zack Space knows a thing or two about ethics'') -- he has a mission of the utmost seriousness in Congress. On Thursday, his first day, before all his boxes were unpacked and his shared apartment furnished, Mr. Space was given a high-profile role in introducing his party's ethics reform package.
''The winds of change have brought me here,'' Mr. Space said in his first speech on the House floor, arguing in favor of the package. ''The time to act is now. We have an extraordinary burden to prove to those who have given us this honor. We must make clear to them that we are representing their interests, not bartering legislative favors in order to gain gifts and trips.''
On the other side of the Capitol dome, the incoming senators will not cast their first votes until next week (and the first one, a resolution honoring the late President Gerald R. Ford, will not exactly cause heartburn). Their transition will take longer in other ways: new senators are housed in temporary offices in the basement, while administrators try to establish which sitting senators intend to move.
That left freshman Senator Jon Tester, a Democrat who previously lived on an 1,800-acre ranch in Montana, squeezed into a small space in the bowels of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. In the office of Senator James Webb, Democrat of Virginia, the phone system was so problem-plagued that his line remained busy for hours on end.
But the wave of newcomers was most palpable in the House, where the dozens of arrivals circulated through welcome parties, herded their families on tours and waited in long lines to have their photographs taken with Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the new House speaker. Representative Carol Shea Porter, a New Hampshire Democrat who won an upset victory, let out an audible gasp when she set foot on the House floor the first time, said her chief of staff, Harry Gural.
''Walking in was a little bit like walking into the lights of Yankee Stadium, going out onto the field as a player rather than a spectator,'' Mr. Gural said.
The cable network channel C-Span chronicled even the most anonymous new members, setting up a camera position in the Cannon House Office Building to lure members of the freshman class into interviews.
''So far, so good,'' said Representative Mazie K. Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii (and one of two new Buddhist members of the Congress), as she concluded her 15 minutes of C-Span.
Ms. Hirono had a press schedule, but little else: unable to buy office gear until she was sworn in, the newest Democrat from the farthest state was working without computers.
Unlike earlier eras, when newcomers simply showed up in Washington and had to fend for themselves, freshmen now undergo a series of orientation programs in the weeks between Election Day and the swearing-in.
''It's much different than when I came here. You were on your own,'' said Representative George Miller, a California Democrat now in his 17th term.
Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and another House lifer, offered the freshmen some advice: Learn time management, and how to resist invitations to social events.
''The default answer when people ask you to do things should be 'no,' '' Mr. Frank said.
Then there is the issue of housing, always tricky for members of Congress who are in Washington on weekdays but at home in their districts most weekends. Mr. Space and his new roommate, Representative Michael Arcuri of New York, moved into their ''small, subterranean'' apartment earlier in the week, an arrangement prompted in part by Mr. Arcuri's fondness for Mr. Space's Greek cooking. By Friday, they still appeared to be getting along.
And Mr. Space, grinning as he wandered the halls, had not grown disillusioned by Washington, he said, nor strayed from his pledges.
''Not yet,'' he said, when asked if he had broken any campaign promises. Then he corrected himself. ''I mean -- no.''

A surge in murders since the new year has residents on edge and has raised new fears that officials here remain helpless to contain a lethal combination of guns, drugs and jobless young men.
The worries are particularly acute as this city struggles to repopulate 17 months after Hurricane Katrina.
Residents fear that officials are helpless to contain a lethal combination of guns, drugs and jobless young men.
A surge in murders since the new year has residents on edge and has raised new fears that officials here remain helpless to contain a lethal combination of guns, drugs and jobless young men.
The worries are particularly acute as this city struggles to repopulate 17 months after Hurricane Katrina.
Eight people have been found dead since Jan. 1, seven of them shooting victims, with the most recent being a young woman found lying on her bed in the Uptown section Friday morning, shot in the head.
As the police were scrambling to investigate that killing and the others, mostly of young men gunned down in high-crime areas, grief-stricken neighbors gathered outside the house of Helen Hill, an independent filmmaker, and her husband, Dr. Paul Gailiunas, who were shot by an intruder early Thursday morning in the Faubourg Marigny section, the authorities said.
Ms. Hill, 36, well known in the local film community and the recipient of several awards, was killed; Dr. Gailiunas, who specialized in treating the city's poor, survived his wounds. The police found him kneeling by the front door, bleeding and holding the couple's 2-year-old son in his arms. His wife lay nearby, shot in the neck. The child was not hurt.
That crime, breaking the typical pattern of drug-related shootings, helped prompt a front-page headline in The Times-Picayune on Friday: ''Killings bring the city to its bloodied knees.''
The spate of murders came after a New Year's Day statement by the city's police superintendent, Warren J. Riley, that New Orleans had been made safer because the 2006 murder total was the lowest in 30 years.
But the assertion was questionable even before these killings started. On a per-capita basis, because of the city's drastically reduced population after Hurricane Katrina, the murder rate of at least 81 per 100,000 people in 2006 easily makes New Orleans one of the most violent cities in the nation.
On Friday, flowers and scribbled remembrances fronted the modest duplex of Ms. Hill and her husband on North Rampart Street, in a picturesque neighborhood of old Creole cottages frequented by tourists and local residents escaping the crowds of the nearby French Quarter.
Both were remembered as outsiders -- Dr. Gailiunas is from Canada, friends said, and his wife from South Carolina -- with a fervent commitment to the city's culture and its underclass.
''You know what, it's horrifying: you kill my wife, you shoot me while I'm holding my baby,'' said Darlene Wright, who said Dr. Gailiunas had treated her two sons at the low-cost clinic he started on Esplanade Avenue. ''He was different from the other doctors. It didn't matter what your color or culture. He cared about the people.''
Friends said Dr. Gailiunas had been released from the hospital Friday afternoon and that he planned to return to Canada. The police said his wounds were not life-threatening but they could not confirm his release.
Ms. Hill, a Harvard graduate and recipient of a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship, had shown her films at numerous festivals in Canada and the United States.
''Things didn't matter to them, their whole focus was on people and partaking in the culture of what was happening in New Orleans,'' said Carlton Charles, Dr. Gailiunas's landlord at the Esplanade clinic.
Previously, the doctor had worked in the high-crime, impoverished Central City area.
''He wanted to reach out to the poor and the underprivileged, people he felt had a lot of needs,'' Dr. Henry Evans, a colleague there, said.
On Friday, David Jones, the owner of a bed-and-breakfast near the couple's home, described how, shortly before the shooting, a lanky gun-wielding intruder -- possibly the same one who shot the couple -- had forced his way into his establishment, but apparently fled after panicked guests called the police.
The other recent killings followed a depressingly familiar pattern. Earlier Thursday, the police found a young man with gunshot wounds lying face-down in a Central City alleyway; on Wednesday evening, they responded to a report of gunshots in the same neighborhood and found another young man dead; that afternoon, Louisiana National Guardsmen found the body of a man shot in the head in the Desire area, in the Ninth Ward; and on Wednesday morning, they found the body of a woman wrapped in a rug in the Lower Ninth Ward.
The National Guard is patrolling several sections of the city at the request of the Police Department, which is still low on manpower. Superintendent Riley, who has been out of town, and other senior police officials did not respond to requests for comment on the violence.
Compounding residents' fears here is the apparent inability of the criminal justice system to successfully prosecute the murderers. A study by the Metropolitan Crime Commission of New Orleans, a foundation, found that from October 2003 to September 2004, only 12 percent of those arrested for murder were incarcerated.
''You know, there are people in this neighborhood trying to bring it back,'' said Mr. Jones, the bed-and-breakfast owner. ''I'm tired of this. I'm ready to torch the whole neighborhood.''

The trail of the crime spree is brutal and damning: a burned-out minivan, a string of victims viciously beaten and robbed, a dead man's body found floating near a boathouse in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens.
Behind the monthlong mayhem are two teenagers, the police said yesterday, and they said one of them, who is homeless, told investigators that he and his partner beat and robbed lone strollers in the park for cash to buy food. On Thursday, the police arrested the homeless teenager, Belter Yovanni Gubara Rivera, 17, and charged him with murder in the death of Carlos Flores, 40. Mr. Flores was an immigrant from Ecuador whose body was found floating in a pond in the park on Dec. 5. Mr. Rivera was also charged with four counts of robbery.

The trail of the crime spree is brutal and damning: a burned-out minivan, a string of victims viciously beaten and robbed, a dead man's body found floating near a boathouse in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens.
Behind the monthlong mayhem are two teenagers, the police said yesterday, and they said one of them, who is homeless, told investigators that he and his partner beat and robbed lone strollers in the park for cash to buy food. On Thursday, the police arrested the homeless teenager, Belter Yovanni Gubara Rivera, 17, and charged him with murder in the death of Carlos Flores, 40. Mr. Flores was an immigrant from Ecuador whose body was found floating in a pond in the park on Dec. 5. Mr. Rivera was also charged with four counts of robbery.
The police arrested the second teenager, Marcos Polanco, 17, who they say was Mr. Rivera's partner, at his home in Corona a day earlier. He was charged with attempted murder and four counts of robbery.
The teenagers are accused of committing four robberies in the park from Nov. 22 to Dec. 25, attacking men who were walking alone. After spotting a mark, they would follow him for awhile, creep up from behind, then try to knock him out, said Lt. Edward Ruttler of the 110th Precinct. In at least two of the robberies, they threatened their victims with a knife, Lieutenant Ruttler said. The two are also suspected in four other robberies that took place during that same time span.
''They both said they did it for food,'' the lieutenant said. Mr. Rivera, he said, had been kicked out of a relative's house two months ago and had been sleeping in an abandoned building at 104th Street and Otis Avenue.
Mr. Rivera, whose nickname is Nyquil, ''was known to put people to sleep,'' Lieutenant Ruttler said, ''to knock them out with one punch.''
''Even though he wasn't physically big, Yovanni knew how to throw a punch,'' he said.
The police said the two became ruthless in their attacks, which usually yielded less than handsome returns. But for the pittance they took, their victims paid a hefty cost.
One victim, Jae Woo Park, 36, of Little Neck, was attacked and severely beaten on Dec. 25, the police said. The circumstances of the attack were unclear yesterday, but at some point, Mr. Park's 2007 Honda Odyssey was taken and set on fire, the police said. The minivan was later found, burning, near the Horace Harding Expressway. Mr. Park, the police said, was still unconscious yesterday at Elmhurst Hospital Center.
When he was arrested, Mr. Rivera had severe burns on his face, said Louis Croce, the chief of detectives in Queens. The medical examiner's office has said the burns were the result of a flash ignition injury consistent with someone setting a vehicle on fire, the police said.
The teenagers' crime spree turned deadly on Dec. 4, the police said, when they set upon Mr. Flores, who lived in Ridgewood, Queens. He fought back, but paid with his life.
His body, with multiple slash wounds and skull fractures, was found at 10:30 the next morning, floating in the pond, the police said. Lieutenant Ruttler said Mr. Rivera had used a machete in the attack.
Mr. Polanco, a dishwasher in Manhattan, has no criminal history. Mr. Rivera was arrested once before, but the details were sealed, police said.
Investigators tracked down the teenagers using evidence like transaction records from a credit card the pair are accused of stealing from one victim, and the burned-out minivan, which investigators were able to trace to Mr. Park, the police said. But most damning of all, they said, were the young men's confessions.

One night in October, a police officer in Madison, a small coastal Connecticut town, called in to dispatchers, telling them that he noticed a door to a restaurant had been left ajar. Not to worry, he said, he would check it out.
In went the officer, Joseph R. Gambardella, though he did not use the usual protocol to search for an intruder, like reaching for his weapon or calling for backup, according to a state police officer who investigated the matter. Rather, Officer Gambardella, toting a large trash bag, went right for the freezer.
A police officer in Madison stand accused stealing lobster when he was investigating an open door at a restaurant.
One night in October, a police officer in Madison, a small coastal Connecticut town, called in to dispatchers, telling them that he noticed a door to a restaurant had been left ajar. Not to worry, he said, he would check it out.
In went the officer, Joseph R. Gambardella, though he did not use the usual protocol to search for an intruder, like reaching for his weapon or calling for backup, according to a state police officer who investigated the matter. Rather, Officer Gambardella, toting a large trash bag, went right for the freezer.
Officer Gambardella rummaged through a few plastic tubs, according to the state police officer's affidavit, removing a few packages of lobster meat.
And out he went, closing the door behind him.
Little did he know that security cameras installed at the restaurant to monitor employees showed him emerging from the freezer with his trash bag weighed down, apparently with a hefty supply of lobster meat.
Although the affidavit from the state trooper includes a detailed account of what was captured on the security tape, Officer Gambardella's lawyer said on Thursday that his client planned to plead not guilty to charges including two counts of burglary and two counts of larceny. The officer is accused of taking 21 bags of lobster meat worth $44 each, and two bags of shrimp, which cost $18.60 apiece.
''The tape seems damaging,'' the officer's lawyer, Hugh F. Keefe, said this week. ''Of course, we have a defense.''
But neither Mr. Keefe nor Officer Gambardella, 48, who was accompanied to court this week by his pregnant wife, Kathleen, gave any indication what that defense might be.
Officer Gambardella, a 15-year veteran of the Madison Police Department who lives in Guilford, was disciplined once before for ''conduct unbecoming,'' according to the town's police chief, Paul D. Jakubson. ''But that's usually nothing serious,'' Chief Jakubson said, adding that he had not received any complaints about Officer Gambardella -- who earned more than $127,000 last year by working overtime shifts -- in the last decade.
Lenny and Joe's Fish Tale along Route 1 in Madison, 20 miles south of New Haven, is not a place for high-end dining. The lobster special, at $12.99, comes with French fries and coleslaw.
Joseph Schreck, one of the owners, called the police after he noticed that a few bags of the crustaceans had disappeared in August and October. And he watched the tape from the hidden camera, thinking perhaps an employee had stolen the food. In both instances, the restaurant's alarm had been activated just after midnight.
Instead, the camera captured Officer Gambardella heading for the cooler and, according to the affidavit, emerging with an ''expanded and weighed-down'' trash bag; then, he appeared to be talking to the alarm security company, using a white towel to cover the receiver.
Mr. Schreck is not exactly thrilled with the publicity surrounding his fast-food seafood place, which has served clams, lobster and shrimp along the shore since 1979. And he declined to elaborate on the case and charges against Officer Gambardella, saying he did not ''want to encourage people to write about this.''
''It's an awkward situation all around,'' Mr. Schreck said in a brief telephone conversation. ''There's nothing for us to be gained by talking about it.''
Officer Gambardella has been on paid leave since October, pending the completion of a criminal investigation.
On Thursday, Mr. Keefe, the lawyer, said that Officer Gambardella was not the first person to be accused of stealing shellfish.
''Have I ever represented anybody who was accused of taking lobster meat and shrimp theft before? The answer is yes,'' he said. ''Lobster theft is very common. We're on the shore. There are a lot of lobster pots around here.''

It was not from the neighborhood.
The object that tore through the roof of a house in the New Jersey suburbs earlier this week was an iron meteorite, perhaps billions of years old and maybe ripped from the belly of an asteroid, experts who examined it said yesterday.
It was not from the neighborhood.
The object that tore through the roof of a house in the New Jersey suburbs earlier this week was an iron meteorite, perhaps billions of years old and maybe ripped from the belly of an asteroid, experts who examined it said yesterday.
Tentatively named ''Freehold Township'' for the place where it landed -- and ruined a second-floor bathroom -- the meteorite is only the second found in New Jersey, said Jeremy S. Delaney, a Rutgers University expert who examined it.
''It's a pretty exciting find,'' said Dr. Delaney, who has examined thousands of meteorites. He said that the first New Jersey meteorite was found in 1829, in the seaside town of Deal.
The meteorite now belongs to the family whose house it ended up in, said Lt. Robert Brightman of the Freehold Township Police Department. The family has asked not to be identified. For the time being, their meteorite is being safeguarded by the police.
The family has not yet given permission for physical testing of the meteorite, but from looking at it, Dr. Delaney and other experts were able to tell that the object it had been part of cooled relatively quickly.
''Which could mean hundreds or thousands of years,'' said Dr. Delaney. ''On a geological time scale, fast and slow are funny words,'' he added.
It is magnetic, and reasonably dense, they determined. The leading edge -- the one that faced forward as it traveled through the earth's atmosphere -- was much smoother, while the so-called trailing edge seemed to have caught pieces of molten metal.
In fact, Mr. Delaney said, it seemed remarkably similar to another meteorite fragment, the Ahnighito, now on display at the American Museum of Natural History.
''This little guy is a lot like it,'' he said. ''It's a good candidate for the core of an asteroid.''
And the scientists are hoping that the owners of the ''Freehold Township'' will make it available for testing and public viewing, like the Ahnighito, a 34-ton chunk of the Cape York meteorite found in Greenland.
Or, they could sell it.
''The worth of a meteorite like this is almost completely determined by where it fell,'' said Eric Twelker, a geologist and a dealer in meteorites, who buys and sells perhaps a hundred of them a month on his Web site, meteoritemarket.com. He was speaking of the premium placed on meteorites with a compelling back story, like the football-size rock that crashed into a parked Chevrolet in Peekskill, N.Y., in 1992.
''The fact that it crashed into a house in New Jersey makes it very valuable,'' he said.
Mr. Twelker said he occasionally sells other pieces of the Cape York meteorite, which go for between $5 and $10 a gram. The Freehold meteorite, which weighs 377 grams, or about 13 ounces, might sell for as much $200 a gram, he said.

China's central bank said late Friday that it had raised the reserve requirement ratio for banks, the fourth increase in six months, to further tighten the nation's money supply.
The modest move, which takes effect this month, increases the reserve ratio by half a percentage point, to 9.5 percent. Analysts said it was the government's latest warning that too much money in the financial system could ignite inflation and perhaps fuel a stock market bubble.
China’s central bank raised the reserve requirement ratio for banks to 9.5 percent to further tighten the nation’s money supply.
China's central bank said late Friday that it had raised the reserve requirement ratio for banks, the fourth increase in six months, to further tighten the nation's money supply.
The modest move, which takes effect this month, increases the reserve ratio by half a percentage point, to 9.5 percent. Analysts said it was the government's latest warning that too much money in the financial system could ignite inflation and perhaps fuel a stock market bubble.
''This is a warning shot,'' said Dong Tao, the chief economist for non-Japan Asia at Credit Suisse. ''If the stock market continues to go up, we might see further tightening.''
Raising the amount of cash reserves that Chinese banks keep on hand with the central bank effectively restricts the amount of money that banks can lend. While not being very restrictive, the central bank aims to curb excessive lending to new factories, real estate projects and road construction.
The move also comes as China's stock market is booming after several years in the doldrums. Last year, the country's key index -- the Shanghai exchange -- rose 130 percent to close at 2,675, a record and the best performance of any major stock exchange in the world in 2006.
The market reached a 16-year high in December, as millions of investors who had been sitting on the sidelines in 2004 and 2005 jumped back into stocks.
Analysts say the government is determined to keep the economy expanding but is concerned about growing so quickly that the economy might crash before 2008, when Beijing is host to the Olympic Games, viewed as the ultimate coming-out party for China.
Overinvestment in real estate and construction has been among the chief worries for the government. And for much of the last two years there have been frequent warnings and government measures to tame a wild property run.
The Central Bank said that last October, for the first time in five years, the bank savings of Chinese citizens decreased from the month before, presumably as more money went into the stock market. Credit Suisse estimated that more than $30 billion in bank deposits have flowed into mutual funds or direct plays into the stock market over the last six weeks.
Many analysts say now that the bull run will continue in 2007, prompting even more money to flow into the market. One Chinese mutual fund raised $5 billion in a single day recently before closing its doors to new investors, an astonishing achievement here, according to some economists.
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which was publicly listed only last October, here in Shanghai and in Hong Kong, has already gained over 70 percent. This week, prices shot up again, before falling sharply Friday.
The run-up means companies in China can once again raise money in the Chinese market rather than relying on the Hong Kong stock market. But huge risks remain in a market that many analysts have long derided as a gambling den crowded with companies with suspect accounting.
Several economists say that more increases are expected in the coming months, to tame the economy and the stock market.
Hong Liang, a Hong Kong-based economist at Goldman Sachs, said that the government had used the reserve ratio as a policy tool to help manage the economy but that it had not been very effective in cooling things down. She did not ''expect it to have much impact on the real economy or the financial markets.''
Large amounts of money flow into the country through foreign investments and surplus dollars from trade. China also has a high savings rate. So many people are looking to put that money to work -- in real estate, the stock market and even by investing in art and antiques.
''A lot of hot money has entered the market, legally and otherwise,'' said Chang Chun, a professor of finance at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, speaking of the stock market. ''In the past few years people were overpessimistic. Right now, they are overoptimistic and they're bringing a lot of money into the market.''

For more than half a century, residents of Hong Kong have taken pride in being more prosperous than their cousins nearby in mainland China, and have enjoyed feeling like big spenders whenever they crossed the border.
Merchants across the border in Shenzhen were happy to take Hong Kong dollars, pocketing the 6 percent premium it commanded over China's currency. Mainland tourists offering Chinese currency here were charged extra or even turned away and told to come back with Hong Kong dollars.
The yuan could pass the traditional benchmark for the Hong Kong dollar’s value as early as next week.
For more than half a century, residents of Hong Kong have taken pride in being more prosperous than their cousins nearby in mainland China, and have enjoyed feeling like big spenders whenever they crossed the border.
Merchants across the border in Shenzhen were happy to take Hong Kong dollars, pocketing the 6 percent premium it commanded over China's currency. Mainland tourists offering Chinese currency here were charged extra or even turned away and told to come back with Hong Kong dollars.
But the yuan is poised to become more valuable than the Hong Kong dollar by the end of the month, and could pass the traditional benchmark for the Hong Kong dollar's value as early as next week. The shift has been the latest in a series of shocks for residents' confidence that they or their ancestors had made the right decision to live in Hong Kong instead of anywhere else in China.
''Nowadays, the gap between China and Hong Kong has narrowed, and some people even think the standard of living in China is higher,'' where prices are lower and incomes are rising quickly, recalled Chan Chi Him, the second generation of a family that has sold birds' nests as a delicacy here since the end of World War II.
''It's easier for Chinese people to make money,'' he said.
Average incomes per person in cities like Beijing, Shanghai or Guangzhou remain a fifth or less of incomes for people in Hong Kong. But the averages in China are dragged down by very large numbers of very poor people.
People in Hong Kong are used to comparing themselves with the educated middle class on the mainland. And they are finding that a growing class of Chinese businessmen and businesswomen have become more affluent than the average resident of Hong Kong.
Millions of middle-class Chinese flock here every year, and shopkeepers are now happy to take Chinese currency, known as the yuan or renminbi.
At the same time, many shopkeepers across the border in China have stopped taking Hong Kong dollars or have begun asking a slightly greater number of dollars than the number of yuan on price tags would suggest.
Prices are rising here in markets for everything from luxury apartments to dried bugs, and the culprit is the same: the rising value of the Chinese yuan and the falling value of the Hong Kong dollar.
The winning bid in a land auction last month worked out to more than $7,000 a square foot once houses are built, making Hong Kong real estate some of the most valuable in the world. Developers are betting that multinationals and mainlanders alike will continue to see Hong Kong as an excellent base for doing business in China.
But Hong Kong also imports much of its food and other goods from the mainland, and the prices are climbing.
Sellers of traditional Chinese medicine are having to pay more for the herbs, insects and other wares they buy from the mainland. The price of dried cicadas, which are boiled in soup to improve eyesight, has risen close to 4 percent in the last year as the yuan has gradually strengthened, said Lee Chun Hung, the chairman of Lee Hoong Kee Ltd., a Chinese medicine wholesaler.
Prices have soared for herbs that are in demand across China, as increasingly affluent mainlanders have bid up prices to levels that many people in Hong Kong cannot afford. A rare root that is boiled in soup and eaten to strengthen the lungs now sells for $618 for a small box, four times its price two years ago.
''It's not just the rise of the renminbi,'' Mr. Lee said, ''it's also because the standard of living is going up on the mainland.''
While prices are starting to creep up here after years of deflation, rising home prices and falling unemployment have helped produce soaring confidence here in the territory's economic future, recent surveys have shown.
The yuan has been rising partly because of calls from the United States and Europe for the Chinese currency to reflect China's rising trade surplus and huge intake of foreign investment.
Chinese officials have also voiced concerns that maintaining a low value for the currency may eventually unleash inflation, although prices are barely rising now on the mainland.
China unified various exchange rates in 1994 and, after several years of gradual appreciation, fixed the exchange rate of the yuan at 8.28 to the dollar in 1998. Beijing officials maintained that level until July 2004. They then began allowing a slow appreciation, with the yuan climbing 3.4 percent last year. It was worth slightly more than 7.81 yuan to the dollar in Friday trading in Shanghai.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority pegged the Hong Kong dollar at 7.8 to the United States dollar in September 1983, and maintained that policy with few changes until June 2005. It then moved to a narrow trading band of 7.75 to 7.85 to the dollar.
The Hong Kong dollar has been trading near the top of that band lately, which is why it is likely that it will take a couple of more weeks for the yuan to reach parity.
Ben Simpfendorfer, a currency strategist at the Royal Bank of Scotland, said that the yuan would surpass the Hong Kong dollar ''definitely before the end of the month.''
While some speculators have raised the idea that the Hong Kong dollar might be repegged to the yuan, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been opposed, and most economists say that the move would be a bad idea. The weaker Hong Kong dollar improves Hong Kong's competitiveness relative to cities on the mainland, and a peg to the yuan would be difficult to maintain.
The yuan is not an internationally traded currency and the Chinese government backs it with a fairly inflexible monetary system in which the economy is controlled less by interest rate changes than by administrative measures, like an order on Friday that banks raise their reserves at the central bank to 9.5 percent of assets, from 9 percent.
The sometimes tumultuous violent history of currency policy in Hong Kong has also discouraged officials. When the Hong Kong dollar plunged in early September 1983, partly on uncertainty over what would happen to the territory after its return to Chinese rule in 1997, gasoline prices climbed because they were set in dollars and taxi drivers responded by holding a protest that turned violent; the Hong Kong dollar has been closely managed ever since.

ADVOCATES for looser restrictions on copyrights had high hopes for the new Democratic Congress. Those hopes faded somewhat last month when Representative Howard L. Berman was named chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees the Internet and intellectual property.
Putting Mr. Berman in charge of the panel, diminishes the chances for ''real reform'' of copyright policy, Lawrence Lessig, perhaps the best-known authority on the legal issues surrounding intellectual property and the Internet, wrote last week on his blog (lessig.org). Change is needed, he wrote, ''to fit the legitimate objectives of copyright -- to assure that artists have the incentives they need to create great new work -- into the contours of digital technology.''

Mr. Berman, though widely regarded as a smart and savvy politician, is a favorite boogeyman of advocates for copyright reform, many of whom say he is in the pocket of his Hollywood constituents (he actually represents the San Fernando Valley, but many media industry figures live there).
In 2002, he introduced a bill that would have allowed media companies to hack into peer-to-peer networks to ''disrupt'' or ''impair'' illicit file trading. The proposed law would have limited the liability of copyright owners to $50 ''per impairment to the property of the affected file trader.''
Critics said the measure, which never got out of committee, would have essentially allowed copyright holders to destroy people's computers with near impunity. Mr. Berman labeled the loudest criticism as ''hysteria,'' and insisted his bill included adequate limitations and consumer protections.
Putting Mr. Berman in charge of the copyright committee ''is like making a congressman from Detroit head of an automobile safety subcommittee, or a senator from Texas head of a global warming subcommittee,'' Mr. Lessig wrote.
NO. 1 WITH A BULLET -- Hitwise, which tracks online traffic trends, reported this week that use of iTunes was up 413 percent on Christmas Day compared with the previous year, beating Microsoft's new Zune service by 30 to 1 (informationweek.com).
Traffic was brisk at Zune, too, though, up 1,030 percent over the previous Monday. Traffic on iTunes was up 1,222 percent during the same period. The increase, of course, came mostly from people who received iPods as gifts. The Apple Store section of iTunes showed an increase in traffic of 110 percent over the previous Christmas. Traffic was so heavy, that customers were complaining about slowdowns and error messages.
ELECTRIC JUNK -- What should be done with those old iPods and other electronics once they've outlived their usefulness? That's not an easy question, thanks to all the toxic chemicals they contain, notes the Web site of Technology Review magazine (technologyreview.com).

While some companies do a good job, ''the majority of recyclers are not responsible recyclers,'' Robin Schneider, a member of the group, told Technology Review. In many countries ''recycled'' electronics end up polluting the land, air and water with mercury, cadmium and other nasty stuff.

There was a touch of parody to the giddy Democrat takeover this week: Nancy Pelosi indulging her inner Haight-Ashbury and dipping the Capitol in tie-dye, sashaying around with the Grateful Dead, Wyclef Jean, Carole King, Richard Gere, feminists and a swarm of well-connected urchins.
The first act of House Democrats who promised to govern with bipartisan comity was imperiously banishing Republicans from participating in the initial round of lawmaking. Even if Republicans were brutes during their reign, Democrats should have shown more class, letting the whiny minority party offer some stupid amendments that would lose.
We don’t know if human beings have free will. We just know that human beings in Washington appear not to.
There was a touch of parody to the giddy Democrat takeover this week: Nancy Pelosi indulging her inner Haight-Ashbury and dipping the Capitol in tie-dye, sashaying around with the Grateful Dead, Wyclef Jean, Carole King, Richard Gere, feminists and a swarm of well-connected urchins.
The first act of House Democrats who promised to govern with bipartisan comity was imperiously banishing Republicans from participating in the initial round of lawmaking. Even if Republicans were brutes during their reign, Democrats should have shown more class, letting the whiny minority party offer some stupid amendments that would lose.
Perhaps the Democrats' power-shift into overdrive is a neurological disorder, or neuropolitical disorder.
If free will is an illusion -- if we are, as one philosopher put it, ''nothing more than sophisticated meat machines,'' doomed to repeat the same mistakes over and over -- that would explain a lot about the latest trend in which everyone is reverting to type.
William James wrote in 1890 that the whole ''sting and excitement'' of life comes from ''our sense that in it things are really being decided from one moment to another, and that it is not the dull rattling off of a chain that was forged innumerable ages ago.''
But in Science Times this week, Dennis Overbye advised Dr. James to ''get over it,'' observing that ''a bevy of experiments in recent years suggest that the conscious mind is like a monkey riding a tiger of subconscious decisions and actions in progress, frantically making up stories about being in control.''
As Mark Hallett of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke told Mr. Overbye, ''Free will does exist, but it's a perception, not a power or a driving force.  The more you scrutinize it, the more you realize you don't have it.''
That would explain why, after voters insisted that the president wrap it up in Iraq, he made a big show of pretending to listen, then decided to do a war do-over.
Is this just the baked-in stubbornness of one man, or is W.'s behavior evidence that he has no free will? Is the Decider freely choosing another huge blunder or is he taking instructions from his genetic and political coding, fearing that if he admits what a foul hash he's made of Iraq, he'll be labeled a wimp, as his dad was?
If W. is trapped on a tiger, he's not the only one.
John McCain can't get beyond seeing himself as a maverick now that he's become a nonmaverick, a right-wing Republican urging an escalation of a hopeless war, even though he's already lived through an escalation of a hopeless war.
''There are two keys to any surge in U.S. troops,'' Senator McCain told an appreciative audience at the American Enterprise Institute yesterday. ''It must be substantial, and it must be sustained.''
With the letter she and Harry Reid wrote to the president yesterday, warning him that ''we are well past the point of more troops for Iraq,'' Speaker Pelosi tried to exert her free will to stop the Surge. But the Democrats aren't willing to take real action and cut off money for the Surge. They're predetermined to want to have it both ways: not to be blamed for the war and not to be blamed for pulling the plug on the war.
Iraq has become a snake pit of factions failing to escape fate. Shiites and Sunnis have been fighting and killing each other for about 1,400 years over who was the rightful heir to Muhammad, and yet the entire American high command was somehow taken aback that Shiites and Sunnis can't muster the free will to keep their country from disintegrating.
Could it have been kismet that there were Shiites taunting Saddam at his hanging? Maybe it was preordained back in the days when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone and the British diplomat Gertrude Bell drew the boundaries of the modern Iraq that a security guy with a cellphone would capture the spectacle.
Despite all the talk back in the 2000 campaign about a robustly experienced foreign-policy dream team, it may have been destined that the Bush administration would be asleep in the run-up to the insurgency, just as it was asleep in the run-up to 9/11, to Katrina, to the occupation and to the refugee crisis in Iraq. Either all that was predetermined, or the administration was preternaturally negligent.
Arthur Schopenhauer, the German philosopher who said a man can do what he wants but cannot will what he wants, would have understood W.'s nonsensical urge to Surge.
We don't know if human beings have free will. We just know that human beings in Washington appear not to.

ONCE again, I am driving, under the blazing equatorial sun, down an uncomfortable, rutty relic of a road into the interior of central Borneo. With me are two uniformed police men, one armed with a machine gun. The landscape is bleak, no trees, no shade as far as the eye can see. Our mission is to confiscate orangutan orphans whose mothers have been killed as a result of the sweeping forest clearance taking place throughout Borneo.
Many years ago, Louis Leakey, the great paleo-anthropologist whose work at Olduvai Gorge and other sites in East Africa revolutionized our knowledge of human origins, encouraged me to study wild orangutans -- just as he had encouraged Jane Goodall to study chimpanzees and Dian Fossey to study gorillas. Later, he laughingly called us the ''trimates,'' or the three primates.
It is the orangutan’s profound connection to the forest that is driving it to extinction.

Many years ago, Louis Leakey, the great paleo-anthropologist whose work at Olduvai Gorge and other sites in East Africa revolutionized our knowledge of human origins, encouraged me to study wild orangutans -- just as he had encouraged Jane Goodall to study chimpanzees and Dian Fossey to study gorillas. Later, he laughingly called us the ''trimates,'' or the three primates.
Orangutans are not as well known as chimpanzees and gorillas. But like their African cousins, orangutans are great apes, our closest living relatives in the animal kingdom, and the most intelligent animals, with the exception of humans, to have evolved on land. Orangutans are reclusive, semi-solitary, quiet, highly arboreal and red, facts that come as a surprise to some people. Their name is derived from the Malay words ''orang hutan,'' which literally mean ''person of the forest.'' And it is the orangutan's profound connection to the forest that is driving it to extinction.
Without forests, orangutans cannot survive. They spend more than 95 percent of their time in the trees, which, along with vines and termites, provide more than 99 percent of their food. Two forests form their only habitat, and they are the tropical rain forests of Borneo and Sumatra.
Sumatra is exclusively Indonesian, as is the two thirds of the island of Borneo known as Kalimantan. That places 80 to 90 percent of the orangutan population, which numbers only 40,000 to 50,000, in Indonesia, with the remainder in Malaysian Borneo. What happens in Indonesia, particularly Kalimantan, will determine the orangutan's future.
When I first arrived in Central Kalimantan in 1971, orangutans were already endangered because of poaching (for the pet trade and for the cooking pot) and deforestation (by loggers and by villagers making way for gardens and rice fields).
But it was all relatively small-time. The forests of Kalimantan were vast -- Indonesia's are the second largest tropical rain forests in the world, after Brazil's -- and forest conversion rates small. People still used axes and saws to cut down trees and traveled by dugout canoes or small boats with inboard engines.
I went straight to work, beginning a wild orangutan study that continues to this day, and establishing an orangutan rehabilitation program, the first in Kalimantan, which has returned more than 300 ex-captive orangutans to the wild.
But the wild is increasingly difficult to find. In the late 1980s, as it entered the global economy, Indonesia decided to become a major producer and exporter of palm oil, pulp and paper. Before this, the government had endorsed selective logging. Now vast areas of forest were slated for conversion to plantations to grow trees for palm oil and paper production. Monster-sized bulldozers, replacing the chain saws of the early logging boom, tore up the forest, clear-cutting as many as 250,000 acres at once for palm oil plantations.
At the same time, the price of wood, particularly the valuable hardwoods that grow in Indonesia's rain forests and fetch a high price on the black market, increased. Illegal logging became rampant, even in national parks and reserves.
While illegal logging degrades the forest, plantations absolutely destroy it. And the destruction is not only immediate, but also long-term. Forest-clearing leaves huge amounts of dry branches and other wood litter on forest floors; a small spark can ignite enormous forest fires, particularly in times of drought. During the 1997 El Niño drought, approximately 25 million acres, an area about half the size of Oklahoma, burned in Indonesia. Thousands of orangutans died.
Indonesia has achieved its goal of becoming one of the two largest palm-oil producers and exporters in the world. But at what cost? At least half of the world's wild orangutans have disappeared in the last 20 years; biologically viable populations of orangutans have been radically reduced in size and number; and 80 percent of the orangutan habitat has either been depopulated or totally destroyed. The trend shows no sign of abating: government maps of future planned land use show more of the same, on an increasing scale.
We're back in the jeep. The police view the trip inland as a success. They confiscated five orangutans and one woman volunteered her crab-eating macaque, an unprotected species. Two of the orangutan owners, both women, shed tears, but we invited them to visit their ''pets'' at the Orangutan Foundation International's Care Center and Quarantine, where they will be rehabilitated and eventually released to the wild.
I am pleased to think that five more orphan orangutans will once again feel the branches and leaves under their feet as they swing through the trees. Yet I am somewhat melancholy. The fragile forests that make orangutan life possible are fast disappearing. Where, I wonder, are the billionaire philanthropists and the international policies that will prevent orangutans -- and all great apes -- from going extinct?
Indonesia is a vast, densely populated country where millions live in or near poverty. The temptation to exploit natural resources to feed people today, never mind tomorrow, and to expand the economy, is great. And the plantations are but one example. Surface-mining of gold in the alluvial fans of white sand has been practiced for two decades, leaving virtual moonscapes near the National Park where I work. Now zircon mining has entrenched itself all over Central Kalimantan, with each zircon mine obliterating 1,000 acres of rain forest. Two years ago nobody, myself included, even knew what zircon was.
The international community must recognize that it has some responsibility for what happens to the great rain forests of Indonesian Borneo. Foreign investment in local development programs needs to be expanded. Village level projects, like the one financed by the United States Agency for International Development and run by Boston-based World Education near where I work, have empowered farmers, strengthened village economies and employed local people, giving them a stake in preserving the forest.
We need more of these programs. Indonesia could also impose a special tax on companies that profit from rain forest destruction, with the revenues dedicated to forest and orangutan conservation. Proper labeling of palm oil content could allow a consumer boycott of soap, crackers, cookies and other products that contain it. Finally, Indonesia needs to be more vigorous in enforcing the excellent laws it already has to protect its forests.
When I arrived in 1971, Borneo was almost a Garden of Eden, the most remote place on earth. Now it has been drawn into the global economy, one government decision, one business plan at a time. But the destruction of Borneo's forests and the extinction of the orangutans are not inevitable. It is possible to protect our ancient heritage and closest of kin -- one orangutan, one national park, one piece of irreplaceable forest at a time. We only need to decide to do it.

When Ryan C. Crocker was trying to improve his Arabic in the late 1970s, he traveled to Jordan, made contact with a desert tribe and settled in for some hands-on training a little different from the standard State Department regimen.
''He wound up being a shepherd for a week or two, chasing down stray sheep and living with the Bedouin,'' said Frederic C. Hof, a retired Army officer and author on the Middle East who recalls reading Mr. Crocker's official report on the trip when they were in language training.

Mr. Crocker, President Bush's choice as the new ambassador to Iraq, has brought the same intensity to his three-decade diplomatic career, amassing a record of Middle East and South Asia experience possibly unrivaled in the United States Foreign Service.
He has served as ambassador to Lebanon, Kuwait, Syria and, since 2004, Pakistan. He reopened the American Embassy in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban. And he knows Iraq well; he worked there in the 1970s, led the State Department's Iraq-Kuwait task force during the Persian Gulf war in 1991 and returned to Baghdad for four months after the 2003 invasion as director of governance for the Coalition Provisional Authority.
In confronting Iraq's sectarian mayhem and the baffling mix of religious, political and tribal interests, he will be able to draw on many years of immersion in trouble spots with similar problems, including Beirut, where he survived the embassy bombing in 1983.
''He's an absolutely first-rate professional who will manage the job with skill and sensitivity,'' said Edward S. Walker Jr., president of the Middle East Institute and a former American ambassador to Egypt and Israel. ''He has the cultural understanding that's so important to working in that region and that country.''
Still, Mr. Walker said, the situation in Iraq is so intractable that it may prove impossible for any envoy to affect events decisively. ''We're facing a division in Iraq that may be beyond anyone's capacity to heal,'' he said.
Assuming he is formally nominated and confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Crocker, 57, will succeed three men who had very different approaches to the job of top American representative in Baghdad. L. Paul Bremer III, who led the Coalition Provisional Authority, had little experience in the region and exercised control over emerging Iraqi leaders that critics found heavy-handed.
John D. Negroponte, the first ambassador to the new government, took the opposite approach, encouraging Iraqis to take on responsibility and trying to remain in the background. Zalmay M. Khalilzad, who succeeded Mr. Negroponte, has taken a far stronger hand in pressing for reconciliation between the Shiite majority and the Sunni minority.
Former colleagues say Mr. Crocker is likely to be a less public presence in the Iraqi capital than Mr. Khalilzad, though they say he will work assiduously behind the scenes for the political accommodation necessary to reverse the slide to civil war.
They describe Mr. Crocker as a tough boss who drives himself as hard as he drives his staff. An accomplished marathon runner, he runs several miles early every morning, even in such danger spots as Beirut, where he was trailed by burly security guards who sometimes had to hop on bicycles to keep up.
Robin L. Raphel, a senior diplomat who worked with Mr. Crocker in Baghdad in 2003, said he was responsible for helping to put together the Iraqi Governing Council, the provisional government that oversaw the country for a year after the fall of Saddam Hussein.
''He's a very good persuader and negotiator,'' Ms. Raphel said. ''He has the background on a lot of the important figures in Iraq, and he's very good at sussing out who's who.''
A former colleague who agreed to speak of Mr. Crocker candidly on condition of anonymity called him ''incredibly hard-working, very serious, a little introverted.''
''I'd say he's more respected than loved in the State Department,'' the colleague said, ''but he certainly is respected. He's done the dirtiest, hardest assignments you can imagine.''
In Pakistan, Mr. Crocker has proved to be an ''old school'' ambassador who has put only limited pressure on President Pervez Musharraf, the military ruler who has sometimes frustrated the Bush administration by failing to act decisively against Al Qaeda and other militant groups, said Husain Haqqani, professor of international relations at Boston University.
''He's not somebody who will come up with a new grand strategy to change the world,'' said Mr. Haqqani, a former Pakistani government official. ''But attempts to craft grand strategy have caused a lot of upheaval in American diplomacy.''
Born June 19, 1949, in Spokane, Wash., Ryan Clark Crocker grew up in an Air Force family and attended school in Morocco, Turkey and Canada, as well as the United States. He graduated from Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash., in 1971 and took his first Foreign Service assignment to the American Consulate in Khorramshahr, Iran, in 1972. He later worked in the embassies in Qatar, Iraq and Egypt. Because he prefers working overseas, he has rarely worked in Washington, but did hold a few posts there, including deputy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs.
He is married to Christine Barnes, a retired Foreign Service secretary, whom he met in Baghdad in 1979. Friends say they own property in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, where a friend said they discussed retiring before Mr. Crocker was named to his current post.
Now Mr. Crocker will face what is likely to be the most demanding assignment of his long career. ''He's capable of doing the juggling act required in Iraq,'' Mr. Haqqani said. ''Let's hope he does it well.''

Like almost all of the American Internet giants that have ventured this far, Google is losing in China. So too, are eBay, Yahoo and Amazon. But flush with cash, Google -- the world's leading search engine company -- is beginning to invest heavily in research and development here. In its latest move, announced Friday, Google struck a deal to invest about $5 million in one of the country's fastest-growing Internet start-ups, Xunlei.com, according to people close to the deal.
That follows another hook-up this week, when Google said it would team with China Mobile, the country's dominant, government-owned mobile telephone carrier, to offer mobile search services using the Internet.

Like almost all of the American Internet giants that have ventured this far, Google is losing in China. So too, are eBay, Yahoo and Amazon. But flush with cash, Google -- the world's leading search engine company -- is beginning to invest heavily in research and development here. In its latest move, announced Friday, Google struck a deal to invest about $5 million in one of the country's fastest-growing Internet start-ups, Xunlei.com, according to people close to the deal.
That follows another hook-up this week, when Google said it would team with China Mobile, the country's dominant, government-owned mobile telephone carrier, to offer mobile search services using the Internet.
In 2005, the company lured Kaifu Lee, the former head of Microsoft research in China, to shore up its base here. And now the company is looking to sprinkle investments in start-ups and partnerships with Chinese companies.
The investment in Xunlei is small compared with Google's $1.65 billion acquisition of YouTube.com last October. But the deals announced this week are an attempt to be smarter about breaking into China's fast-growing but complex Internet market, which now has about 130 million users, making it second in size only to the United States.
With Xunlei, Google gains another path into the rapidly growing demand in China for downloading music and video over the Internet.
''It's not YouTube, but it's close enough,'' says Richard Ji, an Internet analyst at Morgan Stanley. ''Xunlei is a very interesting company. It's a leader in video downloading and so this should help Google in the battle with Baidu.''
Baidu.com is the 500-pound gorilla in China. The company, an Internet search engine start-up began operating only a few years ago and has one of the most-trafficked Web sites in the world. The look of its home page is similar to that of Google, which invested in Baidu several years ago, but then sold its small stake for a huge gain last year, after Baidu went public on the Nasdaq. Other big brand names here are Sina, Sohu, NetEase and Alibaba.com.
According to iResearch, which tracks the search engine market here, Baidu had a commanding 63 percent share of the market in October, the most recent period for which data is available. Google was second, with 19 percent. Yahoo had only 7.6 percent of the market.
One of the most popular features on Baidu.com is downloading music through its MP3 program search service.
Xunlei, based in the southern city of Shenzhen, is gaining popularity. It was started by two computer science graduate students from Duke University, Zou Shenglong and Cheng Hao, in Silicon Valley in 2002. Mr. Zou had previously worked as a technician in Silicon Valley and Mr. Cheng was once a senior manager at Baidu. After getting $20 million in venture backing from Morningside Ventures and IDG VC Partners and moving the company to China in 2003, Xunlei.com seems to have great promise.
Officials at Xunlei.com say that more than 120 million people have used its software, and the company has also signed up some major advertisers, including KFC and Motorola.
Dick X. Wei, an Internet analyst at J. P. Morgan, says a partnership between Google and Xunlei can enhance video and music search content for Google, help Google bolster traffic growth in China and help the company better compete against Baidu.
In announcing the deal on Friday, Kaifu Lee, the president of Google Greater China, said Xunlei's Web site would provide a solid platform for Google. That would help it gain a foothold in the country's booming market for downloading things like video and music, online games, software and cellphone ring tones.
Last month, eBay's struggling China operation was forced to team with Tom.com, a Beijing-based Internet company controlled by the Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing.
Other major American companies have stumbled in China. Monster.com bought China HR, then lost market share. Amazon.com bought Joyo.com, and lost market share. Expedia.com acquired a big Chinese Internet travel company and slipped. And a few years ago, Yahoo bought 3721.com, its biggest competitor here, then handed its operations over to Alibaba.com.
''The globally dominant U.S. Internet companies have failed to take the No. 1 market share position in any category,'' said Jason Brueschke, an Internet analyst at Citigroup. ''And so there's something fundamentally different about this market.''
Some analysts say China's tight regulatory controls over the Internet favor Chinese companies. They also say Chinese companies have been better at creating Internet products for the particular taste of the Chinese. For that reason, some American Internet giants are increasingly looking for Chinese partners.

After eight months of sometimes difficult negotiations, EarthLink and the city of San Francisco said on Friday that they had reached an agreement to create a citywide wireless broadband network.
The Internet search giant Google will provide free service on the network at relatively low transmission speeds, while EarthLink and others will charge for faster service. The monthly fee will be $21.95, but 3,200 low-income residents will be charged $12.95.

''You can't continue to rhetorically talk about the digital divide and not do anything about it,'' Gavin Newsom, the city's mayor, said in an interview.
The network will be built, owned and operated by EarthLink, which last year estimated the initial cost of deployment at about $6 million. EarthLink will also pay certain fees to the city for access to rights of way and city property.
The project has faced opposition from a variety of critics, including some who argued that the city should own the broadband network and some who raised fears of privacy violations. The new agreement establishes some basic privacy protections and requires EarthLink and Google to fully disclose their privacy policies.
Mr. Newsom said that as early as next week he would submit the plan to the County Board of Supervisors, which must give its final approval to the project. The network could begin operating within a year of approval.
Google already owns and operates a free wireless broadband network in Mountain View, the Bay Area city where it is based.
Megan Quinn, a Google spokeswoman, said the company did not plan to require users of the free service to look at advertising.
